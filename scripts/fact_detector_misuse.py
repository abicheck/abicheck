"""Real, repo-wide scan for a direct `==`/`!=` comparison between two
`Fact[T]`-typed values (ADR-063 Phase 0, docs/contribute/plans/
one-semantic-pipeline.md).

A leaf module imported by ``check_ai_readiness.py``, mirroring
``fact_field_readers.py``'s own extraction/registration pattern (itself
mirroring ``engine_cli_boundary.py`` -- ``check_ai_readiness.py`` is
already past the 2000-line hard cap and only stays green through
``LARGE_FILE_ALLOWLIST``, which is not a license to keep growing it).

**Why this exists.** `abicheck/model/fact.py`'s own `Fact` class docstring
already states the rule this check enforces, in the present tense, as if
it already existed: "A detector reads a `Fact[...]`-typed field only by
inspecting `.status` ... The guard against comparing two `Fact[...]`
values directly inside detector logic (rather than unwrapping first) is a
static check, not a runtime one -- see `scripts/check_ai_readiness.py`'s
`fact-detector-misuse` check." No such check existed anywhere in the
repository when this module was written (`grep -rn
"fact-detector-misuse"` before this change matched nothing but that one
docstring sentence) -- this module is what makes that sentence true rather
than a stale promise. `Fact[T]` deliberately does not override `__eq__`
(see that class's own docstring: overriding it would poison the
*containing* dataclass's generated equality the moment comparison reaches
a `Fact`-typed field), so `x.bases_fact == y.bases_fact` does not raise --
it silently falls back to ordinary structural dataclass equality, which
compares `status`/`value`/`diagnostics` together. That is exactly the kind
of comparison a detector must never write: it can be True or False without
ever asking whether either side is even `PRESENT`, quietly reintroducing
the "confirmed absent vs. not collected" ambiguity `Fact[T]` exists to
make unrepresentable, and it does so *silently* -- no exception, no
warning, just a plausible-looking boolean answering the wrong question.

**No type inference**, the identical stance `fact_field_readers.py`
already states for its own scan: this matches the five *known*
`Fact[T]`-bridged field names (`*_fact` attributes on `RecordType`/`Param`)
directly, plus a `Fact(...)`/`Fact.<classmethod>(...)` constructor call on
either side of the comparison -- not "any expression whose static type is
`Fact[T]`," which would need a real type checker this pre-`pip install`
script cannot use. Verified empirically (by running exactly this scan
against the whole package before writing this module) to have zero
existing violations under `abicheck/` today -- every real hit found by a
plain grep for this pattern lives in `tests/` (asserting a constructed
`Fact` equals an expected one, e.g. `assert merged.vptr_offset_bits_fact
== Fact.partial(0)`), which is legitimate test-assertion code, not
detector logic, and is out of this scan's scope (`PKG = ROOT /
"abicheck"`, matching `fact_field_readers.py`'s own scope). So this check
ships with **no baseline at all** -- unlike `fact_field_readers.py`'s
allowlist-and-shrink `KNOWN_UNMIGRATED_READERS`, there is nothing here to
grandfather; any match is a hard, unconditional ERROR.
