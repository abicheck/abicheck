# CLAUDE.md — Instructions for AI agents working on abicheck

## What is abicheck?

ABI compatibility checker for C/C++ shared libraries. Pure Python (3.10+).
Detects 281 ABI/API change types across ELF, PE/COFF, and Mach-O binaries,
categorized into `BREAKING_KINDS`, `API_BREAK_KINDS`, `COMPATIBLE_KINDS`, and `RISK_KINDS` (see `ChangeKind`).
Drop-in replacement for abi-compliance-checker (ABICC).

## Quick reference

```bash
# Install in dev mode (do this first if pytest/ruff/mypy are missing)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run fast unit tests (THE go-to command — ~43s, ~5400 tests)
pytest tests/ -m "not integration and not libabigail and not abicc and not slow and not golden" -q

# Lint (must pass, CI enforces)
ruff check abicheck/ tests/

# Type check (CI runs this — see "Known mypy issues" below)
mypy abicheck/

# Format check
ruff format --check abicheck/ tests/
```

## Test markers — know which tests you can run

| Marker | What it needs | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| *(default)* | Python only | Always run these — fast, no external deps |
| `integration` | castxml + gcc/g++ | Only if modifying DWARF/ELF parsing |
| `libabigail` | abidiff + gcc/g++ | Only for parity testing |
| `abicc` | abi-compliance-checker + gcc/g++ | Only for parity testing |
| `msvc` | MSVC `cl.exe` (Windows) | Only for the MSVC+PDB end-to-end lane |
| `slow` | varies | Hypothesis/perf benchmarks, skip in normal dev |
| `golden` | golden files | Snapshot tests, skip unless changing output format |

**Default fast command excludes all external-tool markers.** Use it.

## Architecture — module map

Entry points:
- `abicheck/cli.py` — Click CLI (large file, at the 2000-line hard cap; be careful with edits)
- `abicheck/compat/cli.py` — ABICC-compatible CLI wrapper
- `abicheck/mcp_server.py` — MCP server for AI agent integration
- `abicheck/__main__.py` — `python -m abicheck` entry

Core pipeline (in order of data flow):
1. **Parsing** — extract metadata from binaries
   - `elf_metadata.py`, `pe_metadata.py`, `macho_metadata.py` — platform-specific
   - `dwarf_metadata.py`, `dwarf_advanced.py`, `dwarf_unified.py` — DWARF debug info
   - `pdb_parser.py`, `pdb_metadata.py`, `pdb_utils.py` — Windows PDB
   - `btf_metadata.py`, `ctf_metadata.py` — Linux kernel debug formats
   - `sycl_metadata.py` — SYCL plugin interface
2. **Snapshot** — `dumper.py` creates `AbiSnapshot` (model in `model.py`)
   - `dumper_castxml.py` — castxml XML → model parser (default L2 header backend)
   - `dumper_clang.py` — `clang -ast-dump=json` → model parser (alternative L2
     backend for clang-only hosts; `--ast-frontend clang` /
     `ABICHECK_AST_FRONTEND=clang`). Both parsers expose the same `parse_*`
     surface behind `dumper._header_ast_parser`.
   - `dwarf_snapshot.py` — DWARF-specific snapshot logic
   - `snapshot_cache.py` — caching layer
3. **Diffing** — compare two snapshots
   - `diff_symbols.py` — function/variable/parameter changes
   - `diff_types.py` — struct/enum/union/typedef changes
   - `diff_platform.py` — ELF/PE/Mach-O specific changes
   - `diff_elf_layout.py` — binary-only (no-DWARF/L0) vtable & RTTI layout diff from `_ZTV`/`_ZTI` symbol sizes
   - `diff_filtering.py` — deduplication and redundancy removal
   - `diff_versioning.py` — symbol version checks
   - `diff_sycl.py` — SYCL-specific diffs
4. **Detection** — classify changes
   - `detectors.py` — individual detection rules
   - `detector_registry.py` — registry pattern for detectors
   - `checker.py` — main comparison orchestrator
   - `checker_types.py` — `DiffResult`, result types
   - `checker_policy.py` — verdict classification (ChangeKind enum lives here)
5. **Policy & Suppression**
   - `policy_file.py` — YAML policy profiles
   - `suppression.py` — suppression rules (YAML + ABICC formats)
   - `severity.py` — severity configuration
6. **Reporting** — output results
   - `reporter.py` — JSON/Markdown/text output
   - `html_report.py` — HTML reports
   - `sarif.py` — SARIF 2.1.0 output
   - `junit_report.py` — JUnit XML output
   - `report_summary.py`, `report_classifications.py` — report helpers
7. **Application compatibility** — `appcompat.py`, `appcompat_html.py`
8. **Utilities**
   - `binary_utils.py` — binary file helpers
   - `binary_fingerprint.py` — rename detection via fingerprinting
   - `demangle.py` — C++ name demangling
   - `classify.py` — symbol classification
   - `annotations.py` — annotation handling
   - `errors.py` — exception types
   - `serialization.py` — snapshot serialization
   - `package.py` — package/archive handling
   - `debian_symbols.py` — Debian symbols file adapter
   - `environment_matrix.py` — multi-env comparison
   - `binder.py` — symbol binding logic
   - `resolver.py` — symbol resolution
   - `type_metadata.py`, `dwarf_utils.py` — shared type helpers
   - `change_registry.py` — change kind registry
   - `service.py` — service layer (Python API)
   - `stack_checker.py`, `stack_report.py`, `stack_html.py` — stack analysis
9. **Build-source evidence (optional L3–L5 layers)** — `buildsource/` package
   (collect/merge/source-ABI replay/source graph; ADR-028…033). See
   `abicheck/buildsource/CLAUDE.md` for its module map.

## Key types

- `AbiSnapshot` (`model.py`) — serializable snapshot of a library's ABI surface
- `DiffResult` (`checker_types.py`) — single detected change with kind, severity, details
- `ChangeKind` (`checker_policy.py`) — enum of 281 change types; categorized into `BREAKING_KINDS`, `API_BREAK_KINDS`, `RISK_KINDS`, and `COMPATIBLE_KINDS` (further split into `ADDITION_KINDS` and `QUALITY_KINDS`)
- `Verdict` (`checker.py`) — overall comparison result (compatible/source_break/breaking)
- `LibraryMetadata` (`checker.py`) — parsed library info

## Adding a new ChangeKind

1. Add to `ChangeKind` enum in `checker_policy.py`
2. Place in exactly one of `BREAKING_KINDS`, `API_BREAK_KINDS`, `COMPATIBLE_KINDS`, or `RISK_KINDS` (import-time assertion enforces completeness)
3. Implement detection in the appropriate diff module
4. Add unit test

## Conventions

- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`)
- **Branches**: `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`
- **Python**: 3.10+ syntax, type annotations, `from __future__ import annotations`
- **No line length limit** (ruff E501 ignored)
- **Tests**: use `assert` freely; parametrize when possible

## Known mypy issues

CI runs `mypy abicheck/` as a required gate. The baseline is currently **0 errors** — the previously-documented 26 errors were all `unused-ignore` / `no-any-return` / `misc` warnings on third-party calls (pyelftools, click). They are suppressed in `pyproject.toml` via per-module `disable_error_code` overrides, which keeps the file portable across mypy releases without churning the underlying `# type: ignore` comments.

**Your responsibility**: run `mypy abicheck/` after your changes and ensure it stays clean. If a new third-party suppression is needed, extend the existing `disable_error_code` override for that module rather than scattering ad-hoc `# type: ignore` comments. If you legitimately reduce a real error to zero, leave `MYPY_ERROR_BASELINE = 0` in `scripts/check_ai_readiness.py` — it now warns on drift in either direction.

## AI-readiness gate

`scripts/check_ai_readiness.py` runs in CI as a fast structural gate. It checks:

| Check | Severity | What it enforces |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| `file-size` | ERROR > 2000 lines, WARN > 1500 | Source files stay legible (no allowlist) |
| `claude-md-coverage` | ERROR | `CLAUDE.md` exists in each major sub-tree |
| `test-ratio` | WARN | At least 20% test-to-source file ratio |
| `future-annotations` | WARN | `from __future__ import annotations` per CLAUDE.md convention |
| `changekind-partition` | ERROR | Every `ChangeKind` is in exactly one of `BREAKING_KINDS` / `API_BREAK_KINDS` / `COMPATIBLE_KINDS` / `RISK_KINDS` |
| `changekind-detector` | WARN | Every `ChangeKind` is produced somewhere (not orphaned) |
| `changekind-docs` | WARN | Every `ChangeKind` is mentioned in `docs/` |
| `doc-count-sync` | ERROR on drift, WARN if anchor moved | Headline counts in docs (ChangeKind count, example-catalog size) match their source of truth (`len(ChangeKind)`, `ground_truth.json`) |
| `cli-contract` | ERROR | No front-end `cli*.py` module calls Tier-1 `checker.compare` directly — it must route through the Tier-2 service (`service.run_compare`/`compare_snapshots`); ADR-037 D10.1 |
| `import-cycles` | ERROR | No import cycles within `abicheck/` |
| `mypy-baseline` | ERROR if drifted up | mypy error count ≤ documented baseline |
| `examples-ground-truth` | ERROR | Every `examples/case*/` has a `README.md` and an entry in `ground_truth.json` |
| `examples-readme-sync` | ERROR | `examples/README.md` headline count, verdict distribution, and case-index rows match `ground_truth.json` (catches missing/stale catalog rows) |
| `mkdocs-nav-coverage` | WARN | Every `docs/**/*.md` is in `mkdocs.yml` nav or linked from another doc |
| `banned-imports` | ERROR | No `print(...)` outside CLI/reporter modules; no `subprocess(..., shell=True)` |
| `license-header` | WARN | Every `abicheck/**/*.py` carries the Apache-2.0 header / SPDX identifier |
| `test-assertion-density` | WARN | Every `test_*` function asserts something (directly or via a same-file helper) — flags zero-assertion smoke tests so coverage isn't "filled" without verification |

Run locally: `python scripts/check_ai_readiness.py`. Errors fail; warnings print and pass.

## Test-quality gates (beyond line coverage)

Line coverage measures *reach*, not whether a test actually checks the result.
Several mechanisms guard test quality so coverage can't be "filled" without verifying behaviour:

- **FP-rate gate** — `scripts/check_fp_rate.py` (mirrored in `tests/test_fp_rate_gate.py`).
  A labelled corpus of `(old, new)` snapshot pairs run under public-surface scoping:
  internal-noise cases must stay non-breaking (no false positives), real-break cases
  must stay breaking (no false negatives). Both baselines are 0; grow the corpus only
  with cases the correct implementation already passes. Cases carry a scoping *axis*
  tag (`CASE_CATEGORY`); `--markdown`/`--json` emit a per-axis FP/FN breakdown for trend
  tracking.
- **Per-tier accuracy gate** — `scripts/check_tier_accuracy.py` (mirrored in
  `tests/test_tier_accuracy_gate.py`). Complements the FP-rate gate by measuring *what
  each evidence level buys*: one labelled change per case is projected down to what each
  tier observes (L0 symbols → L1 debug → L2 headers → L3 build) and run through `compare`;
  verdicts collapse to a 3-band ordinal (non-breaking/risk/breaking). It records, per
  tier, over-calls (false positives) vs under-calls (false negatives) — encoding the
  principle that **adding a layer reduces both** (L1 sees layout but over-calls internal
  churn; L2 scoping removes it; L0/L1 under-call breaks only headers/build see). Gates on
  top-tier correctness + under-call monotonicity (more evidence never hides a break an
  earlier tier caught — authority rule). CI posts the matrix to the step summary. User
  docs: `docs/concepts/evidence-and-detectability.md` § "What each layer buys".
- **Mutation testing** — `scripts/check_mutation_score.py` + `.github/workflows/mutation.yml`.
  `mutmut` mutates the detector core (`diff_*`, `checker_policy`); a *surviving* mutant
  is a covered-but-unverified line. Runs weekly / on the `mutation` PR label, gating on a
  survivor baseline (`SURVIVOR_BASELINE`) once the first run establishes it.
- **Metamorphic property tests** — `tests/test_detector_properties.py` (`slow`).
  Hypothesis-generated snapshot pairs checked against invariants that hold for *any*
  input (idempotence, determinism, direction-symmetry of touched symbols, emitted-kind
  partition, additive monotonicity) — generalization guards, not example-shaped tests.
- **Silent-skip guard** — `tests/conftest.py`. A marker lane can export
  `ABICHECK_MIN_EXECUTED=<n>`; the session fails unless at least `<n>` tests actually ran,
  so a missing external tool can't turn a lane green with zero work done. Wired into the
  `abicc`, `libabigail`, and `integration` CI lanes.

## Line-coverage floor

The fast lane enforces a **95%** line+branch coverage floor (`--cov-fail-under=95`),
but **only on the canonical Linux/Python-3.13 unit-test lane** in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — that's where the full unit suite runs under coverage.
The other Linux Pythons (3.12/3.14) run the same suite *without* coverage (they would
only re-check the identical floor, and coverage instrumentation adds ~60% wall time).
macOS/Windows skip the Linux-only ELF/DWARF parsing tests, which structurally lowers
their coverage (~93% on macOS), so those lanes run the same tests without the
fail-under gate (macOS still emits a coverage report). Coverage uses the
`sys.monitoring` backend (`COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`, Python 3.12+) to keep the
instrumentation cheap. If the macOS lane ever fails on coverage, the fix is to keep the
gate Linux-scoped — **do not lower the global 95% floor** to make another platform pass.

## Files that are large — edit carefully

**Don't trust hard-coded line counts — they drift.** The AI-readiness gate is the
source of truth: it WARNs on any file >1500 lines and ERRORs >2000 (hard cap, no
allowlist). To see today's large files, run:

```bash
python scripts/check_ai_readiness.py 2>&1 | grep "exceeds soft limit"
```

As of this writing the WARN set (>1500 lines) is `cli.py`, `dumper.py`, and
`buildsource/crosscheck.py` — the main CLI, binary-metadata extraction, and the
cross-check engine. Treat that command output (not this sentence) as current.

When editing any large file, read the specific section you need rather than the
whole file. Several big commands have already been split into sibling
`cli_<name>.py` / `diff_*` modules (see the module map above); prefer extending a
split-out module over growing the parent toward the cap.

### Adding a new top-level command

Pick the right home:

- **Small command (one function, no significant helpers)** — add to `cli.py` directly with `@main.command(...)`.
- **Larger command or command group** — add as a sibling `abicheck/cli_<name>.py` module:
  1. Top of module: `from .cli import main` (and any shared `_helpers`).
  2. Decorate with `@main.command("foo")` or `@main.group("foo")` as usual.
  3. At the bottom of `cli.py`, add `cli_<name>` to the side-effect `from . import (...)` block — that runs after `main` and helpers are defined, registering the new command.
  4. If the new module uses `@click` decorators, add `abicheck.cli_<name>` to the `disallow_untyped_decorators = false` override in `pyproject.toml` (alongside the existing entries).
  5. If `scripts/check_ai_readiness.py` flags a cycle, add `frozenset({"cli", "cli_<name>"})` to `IMPORT_CYCLE_ALLOWLIST` — this registration pattern is by design.
  6. **Shared utility flags go through a decorator, not an inline copy.** `-v/--verbose` is `@verbose_option`, `--format`/`-o/--output` are `output_options(...)`, language is `lang_option(...)` (all in `cli_options.py`). Every visible option must carry `help=` text and a shared concept must use one canonical primary spelling — both are enforced by `tests/test_cli_contract.py` (`test_no_option_has_empty_help`, `test_shared_concept_canonical_spelling`).
  7. **Moving helpers out of a module that re-exports them?** If you relocate a helper that an existing module re-exports "for API stability / tests" (e.g. the `cli_buildsource` block), preserve the old import path with a lazy module-level `__getattr__` shim that resolves via `importlib.import_module` — a static `from .new_module import …` re-export would re-introduce the import cycle the split was meant to avoid (see the shim at the tail of `cli_buildsource.py`).

## Exit codes

- `compare` command (legacy, without `--severity-*` flags): 0 = compatible, 2 = source break, 4 = ABI break
- `compare` command (severity-aware, with any `--severity-*` flag): 0 = no error-level findings, 1 = error in addition/quality only, 2 = error in potential_breaking, 4 = error in abi_breaking
- `compat` command: 0 = compatible, 1 = BREAKING, 2 = API_BREAK (source-level), 3-11 = errors (see `compat/cli.py:_classify_compat_error_exit_code`)
- `64` = usage error (bad flags/inputs; `cli._EXIT_USAGE_ERROR`) — applies across commands
- Full per-command matrix: `docs/reference/exit-codes.md`

## What NOT to do

- Don't modify `examples/` test cases without understanding the ground truth they encode
- Don't add dependencies without strong justification (this is a lightweight tool)
- Don't skip test markers — if a test needs `castxml`, mark it `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Don't "fix" the mypy errors listed above by adding `# type: ignore` broadly
- Don't modify binary test fixtures without regenerating expected outputs
- Don't change public API signatures without checking for breaking changes
- Don't add platform-specific code without considering cross-platform compatibility
