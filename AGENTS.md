# AGENTS.md — Canonical instructions for coding agents working on abicheck

This is the **canonical, vendor-neutral** repository contract (CLAUDE.md
"M1-1"). Every tool-specific instruction surface is a thin adapter that
points back here instead of maintaining its own copy:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `AGENTS.md` (this file) | Canonical instructions — the source of truth |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code bootstrap — imports this file via `@AGENTS.md` |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot adapter — points here |
| `.cursor/rules/abicheck.mdc` | Cursor adapter — points here |

If you're editing repository-wide instructions, edit **this file**. Don't
hand-duplicate a command or invariant into an adapter — adapters exist so
each tool's convention is satisfied without a second copy to drift.
Sub-directory `CLAUDE.md` files (`abicheck/CLAUDE.md`, `tests/CLAUDE.md`,
etc.) are scoped, per-area context, not adapters to this file — they stay as
they are.

## What is abicheck?

ABI compatibility checker for C/C++ shared libraries. Pure Python (3.10+).
Detects 395 ABI/API change types across ELF, PE/COFF, and Mach-O binaries,
categorized into `BREAKING_KINDS`, `API_BREAK_KINDS`, `COMPATIBLE_KINDS`, and `RISK_KINDS` (see `ChangeKind`).
Drop-in replacement for abi-compliance-checker (ABICC).

**Two different Python version numbers matter here, don't conflate them:**
`pyproject.toml`'s `requires-python = ">=3.10"` is the *minimum supported*
version (what a user's environment needs to run abicheck) — CI tests 3.12,
3.13, and 3.14 across platforms to keep that floor honest. **3.13** is the
*canonical development/CI* version — `repo_facts.json`'s `canonical_python`,
the single Linux lane the 95% coverage floor runs on (see "Line-coverage
floor" below), and what the `ai-readiness` CI job (including its
`repo_facts.json` mypy-baseline recheck) pins to. The separate
`lint-and-types` job that gates `mypy abicheck/` cleanliness on every PR
runs on 3.14, matching the other non-canonical lanes. When in doubt about
which Python to develop against locally, use 3.13.

## Quick reference

```bash
# Install in dev mode (do this first if pytest/ruff/mypy are missing)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run fast unit tests (THE go-to command — ~43s, ~5400 tests)
pytest tests/ -m "not integration and not libabigail and not abicc and not slow and not golden" -q

# Lint (must pass, CI enforces)
ruff check abicheck/ tests/

# Type check (CI runs this — see "Known mypy issues" below)
mypy abicheck/

# Format check
ruff format --check abicheck/ tests/
```

### M0-3: `scripts/verify.py` — the one verification contract

The four commands above are the everyday inner loop, but they are **not**
the definition of "ready for PR" — the canonical CI unit lane runs golden
tests and enforces a 95% coverage floor that the fast command above
deliberately skips. `scripts/verify.py` is the single executable
orchestrator every consumer (pixi, pre-commit, CI, this file) calls through,
so the local and CI definitions of done cannot silently diverge again:

```bash
python scripts/verify.py --profile fast   # the four commands above, bundled
python scripts/verify.py --profile pr     # exact CI-equivalent PR gate (incl. golden + coverage floor + ai-readiness)
python scripts/verify.py --profile full   # + external-tool/parity/performance lanes, skipped where the environment lacks the tool

python scripts/verify.py --profile pr --list          # show the steps a profile runs, without running them
python scripts/verify.py --profile pr --only lint,typecheck   # run a subset
python scripts/verify.py --profile pr --json receipt.json     # machine-readable pass/fail/skip receipt
```

**Before opening a PR, run `--profile pr` (or `pixi run check`, which calls
the identical command) — not just the fast command above.**
`tests/test_verify_profiles.py` asserts that `pixi run check`,
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` all route through
`scripts/verify.py`'s step catalog rather than keeping independent copies of
these commands; if you change a check, change it in `scripts/verify.py` and
let that test tell you what else needs updating.

**`pip install -e ".[dev]"` alone is not full `pr`-profile parity.** The
`docs-build` step needs `mkdocs` (`pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"`) and the
`distribution-build` step needs `build`/`twine` (`pip install -e ".[dev,dist]"`)
— neither is in bare `[dev]`, matching the CI `lint-and-types`/`fair-metadata`
jobs' separate installs. Run `pip install -e ".[dev,docs,dist,mcp]"` for full
parity — the `mcp` extra matches what the CI `unit-tests` job itself installs
(`pip install -e ".[dev,mcp]"`), so the generated-doc mirror tests that need
it (`tests/test_mcp_reference.py`) actually run instead of silently skipping.
`verify.py` never silently claims success when *its own* step is skipped for
a missing tool: a `pr`-profile run with any step-level skip prints an explicit
`WARNING: this pr-profile run is INCOMPLETE` line and sets `"complete": false`
in the `--json` receipt — don't treat a skip-containing run as equivalent to
a clean CI pass. That completeness tracking is at the *step* level, though
(`unit-pr` = "did `pytest tests/...` run"), not inside pytest itself — a test
module that skips itself via `pytest.importorskip("mcp")` when the extra is
missing still reports `unit-pr` as passed, with no separate warning for that
one file. Installing `mcp` (as above) is what actually closes that gap
locally; don't rely on `verify.py`'s completeness line alone to catch it.

[pixi](https://pixi.sh) is also supported (`pixi install && pixi run test`,
`pixi run check`) and additionally manages the `castxml`/compiler/`libabigail`/
`abi-compliance-checker` system tools for the `integration`/`libabigail`/`abicc`
marker lanes below — see `[tool.pixi.*]` in `pyproject.toml` and
`CONTRIBUTING.md`. Unlike bare `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, pixi's `default`
environment includes the `docs` and `dist` features too, so `pixi run check`
is complete out of the box. Prefer `pip install -e ".[dev]"` above when pixi
isn't available in your environment (add `,docs,dist` for full parity).

## Test markers — know which tests you can run

| Marker | What it needs | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| *(default)* | Python only | Always run these — fast, no external deps |
| `integration` | castxml + gcc/g++ | Only if modifying DWARF/ELF parsing |
| `libabigail` | abidiff + gcc/g++ | Only for parity testing |
| `abicc` | abi-compliance-checker + gcc/g++ | Only for parity testing |
| `msvc` | MSVC `cl.exe` (Windows) | Only for the MSVC+PDB end-to-end lane |
| `slow` | varies | Hypothesis/perf benchmarks, skip in normal dev |
| `golden` | golden files | Snapshot tests, skip unless changing output format |

**Default fast command excludes all external-tool markers.** Use it.

## Architecture — module map

Entry points:
- `abicheck/cli.py` — Click CLI (large file, at the 2000-line hard cap; be careful with edits)
- `abicheck/compat/cli.py` — ABICC-compatible CLI wrapper
- `abicheck/mcp_server.py` — MCP server for AI agent integration
- `abicheck/__main__.py` — `python -m abicheck` entry

Core pipeline (in order of data flow):
1. **Parsing** — extract metadata from binaries
   - `elf_metadata.py`, `pe_metadata.py`, `macho_metadata.py` — platform-specific
   - `dwarf_metadata.py`, `dwarf_advanced.py`, `dwarf_unified.py` — DWARF debug info
   - `pdb_parser.py`, `pdb_metadata.py`, `pdb_utils.py` — Windows PDB
   - `btf_metadata.py`, `ctf_metadata.py` — Linux kernel debug formats
   - `sycl_metadata.py` — SYCL plugin interface
2. **Snapshot** — `dumper.py` creates `AbiSnapshot` (model in `model.py`)
   - `dumper_castxml.py` — castxml XML → model parser (default L2 header backend)
   - `dumper_clang.py` — `clang -ast-dump=json` → model parser (alternative L2
     backend for clang-only hosts; `--ast-frontend clang` /
     `ABICHECK_AST_FRONTEND=clang`). Both parsers expose the same `parse_*`
     surface behind `dumper._header_ast_parser`.
   - `dwarf_snapshot.py` — DWARF-specific snapshot logic
   - `snapshot_cache.py` — caching layer
3. **Diffing** — compare two snapshots
   - `diff_symbols.py` — function/variable/parameter changes
   - `diff_types.py` — struct/enum/union/typedef changes
   - `diff_platform.py` — ELF/PE/Mach-O specific changes
   - `diff_elf_layout.py` — binary-only (no-DWARF/L0) vtable & RTTI layout diff from `_ZTV`/`_ZTI` symbol sizes
   - `diff_filtering.py` — deduplication and redundancy removal
   - `diff_versioning.py` — symbol version checks
   - `diff_sycl.py` — SYCL-specific diffs
4. **Detection** — classify changes
   - `detectors.py` — individual detection rules
   - `detector_registry.py` — registry pattern for detectors
   - `checker.py` — main comparison orchestrator
   - `checker_types.py` — `DiffResult`, result types
   - `checker_policy.py` — verdict classification (ChangeKind enum lives here)
5. **Policy & Suppression**
   - `policy_file.py` — YAML policy profiles
   - `suppression.py` — suppression rules (YAML + ABICC formats)
   - `severity.py` — severity configuration
6. **Reporting** — output results
   - `reporter.py` — JSON/Markdown/text output
   - `html_report.py` — HTML reports
   - `sarif.py` — SARIF 2.1.0 output
   - `junit_report.py` — JUnit XML output
   - `report_summary.py`, `report_classifications.py` — report helpers
7. **Application compatibility** — `appcompat.py`, `appcompat_html.py`
8. **Utilities**
   - `binary_utils.py` — binary file helpers
   - `binary_fingerprint.py` — rename detection via fingerprinting
   - `demangle.py` — C++ name demangling
   - `classify.py` — symbol classification
   - `annotations.py` — annotation handling
   - `errors.py` — exception types
   - `serialization.py` — snapshot serialization
   - `package.py` — package/archive handling
   - `debian_symbols.py` — Debian symbols file adapter
   - `environment_matrix.py` — multi-env comparison
   - `binder.py` — symbol binding logic
   - `resolver.py` — symbol resolution
   - `type_metadata.py`, `dwarf_utils.py` — shared type helpers
   - `change_registry.py` — change kind registry
   - `service.py` — service layer (Python API)
   - `stack_checker.py`, `stack_report.py`, `stack_html.py` — stack analysis
9. **Build-source evidence (optional L3–L5 layers)** — `buildsource/` package
   (collect/merge/source-ABI replay/source graph; ADR-028…033). See
   `abicheck/buildsource/CLAUDE.md` for its module map.

Beyond the core package: `.github/AGENTS.md` (CI/workflow architecture),
`action/AGENTS.md` (the composite GitHub Action's shell-script layer), and
`contrib/abicheck-clang-plugin/AGENTS.md` (the optional Clang facts plugin)
cover the surrounding first-party trees this file doesn't detail.

## Key types

- `AbiSnapshot` (`model.py`) — serializable snapshot of a library's ABI surface
- `DiffResult` (`checker_types.py`) — single detected change with kind, severity, details
- `ChangeKind` (`checker_policy.py`) — enum of 395 change types; categorized into `BREAKING_KINDS`, `API_BREAK_KINDS`, `RISK_KINDS`, and `COMPATIBLE_KINDS` (further split into `ADDITION_KINDS` and `QUALITY_KINDS`)
- `Verdict` (`checker.py`) — overall comparison result (compatible/source_break/breaking)
- `LibraryMetadata` (`checker.py`) — parsed library info

## Adding a new ChangeKind

1. Add to `ChangeKind` enum in `checker_policy.py`.
2. Add ONE `ChangeKindMeta` entry (kind string, `default_verdict`, optional
   `impact`/`description_template`) to `abicheck/change_registry.py` or one
   of its sibling `change_registry_<topic>.py` files (`_castxml`,
   `_buildsource`, `_composition`, `_coverage`, `_numpy`, `_suppression` —
   split out only to stay under the file-size cap; declaring an entry in any
   of them is equivalent). **Do NOT hand-edit `BREAKING_KINDS`/
   `API_BREAK_KINDS`/`COMPATIBLE_KINDS`/`RISK_KINDS` in `checker_policy.py`
   directly** — those are `frozenset`s *derived* from the registry at import
   time (`_kinds_for(...)`); the registry entry's `default_verdict` is what
   actually places a kind into one of them, and the import-time completeness
   assertion checks the derived sets, not a set you'd edit by hand.
3. Implement detection in the appropriate diff module, registered via
   `@registry.detector("...")` (`detector_registry.py`) the way the
   neighboring detectors in that file are.
4. Add unit test.

## Conventions

- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`)
- **Branches**: `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`
- **Python**: 3.10+ syntax, type annotations, `from __future__ import annotations`
- **No line length limit** (ruff E501 ignored)
- **Tests**: use `assert` freely; parametrize when possible
- **Changelog**: if your change touches `abicheck/**/*.py`, add a fragment
  with `scriv create` — writes `changelog.d/<name>.md`; uncomment one
  `### <Category>` section and describe the change (see
  `changelog.d/README.md`). Do **not** hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`'s
  `## [Unreleased]` section — CI (`changelog-check.yml`) rejects a PR that
  touches `abicheck/**/*.py` without a fragment, and every PR editing that
  shared section directly was the reason it kept conflicting.

## Known mypy issues

CI runs `mypy abicheck/` as a required gate. The baseline is currently **0 errors** — the previously-documented 26 errors were all `unused-ignore` / `no-any-return` / `misc` warnings on third-party calls (pyelftools, click). They are suppressed in `pyproject.toml` via per-module `disable_error_code` overrides, which keeps the file portable across mypy releases without churning the underlying `# type: ignore` comments.

**Your responsibility**: run `mypy abicheck/` after your changes and ensure it stays clean. If a new third-party suppression is needed, extend the existing `disable_error_code` override for that module rather than scattering ad-hoc `# type: ignore` comments. If you legitimately reduce a real error to zero, leave `MYPY_ERROR_BASELINE = 0` in `scripts/check_ai_readiness.py` — it now warns on drift in either direction.

## AI-readiness gate

`scripts/check_ai_readiness.py` runs in CI as a fast structural gate. It checks:

| Check | Severity | What it enforces |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| `file-size` | ERROR > 2000 lines, WARN > 1500 | Every first-party Python tree (`abicheck/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `eval/`, `validation/`, `action/`, the clang plugin's `tests/` — `FIRST_PARTY_PY_ROOTS`) stays legible. `LARGE_FILE_ALLOWLIST` downgrades a specific pre-existing violator to WARN with a reviewed reason — it is not a way to silently exempt a new file |
| `claude-md-coverage` | ERROR | `CLAUDE.md` exists in each original major sub-tree (`REQUIRED_CLAUDE_MD_DIRS`) |
| `agent-instructions-coverage` | ERROR | `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` exists in `.github/`, `action/`, `contrib/abicheck-clang-plugin/` (`REQUIRED_AGENT_INSTRUCTION_DIRS`) |
| `script-inventory` | WARN | Every `scripts/*.py` is named in `scripts/CLAUDE.md`'s inventory table — an unlisted script is invisible to that discovery path |
| `generated-file-ownership` | ERROR | A known-generated file (`GENERATED_FILE_MARKERS`, plus every `docs/reference/examples/case*.md`) still carries its "this is generated, don't hand-edit" marker comment |
| `test-ratio` | WARN | At least 20% test-to-source file ratio; test files are discovered recursively under `tests/` (not just top-level) |
| `future-annotations` | WARN | `from __future__ import annotations` per this file's convention |
| `changekind-partition` | ERROR | Every `ChangeKind` is in exactly one of `BREAKING_KINDS` / `API_BREAK_KINDS` / `COMPATIBLE_KINDS` / `RISK_KINDS` |

| `changekind-docs` | WARN | Every `ChangeKind` is mentioned in `docs/` |
| `doc-count-sync` | ERROR on drift, WARN if anchor moved | Headline counts in docs (ChangeKind count, example-catalog size) match their source of truth (`len(ChangeKind)`, `ground_truth.json`) — this file (`AGENTS.md`) is included in the generic sweep, same as `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` |
| `cli-contract` | ERROR | No front-end `cli*.py` module calls Tier-1 `checker.compare` directly — it must route through the Tier-2 service (`service.run_compare`/`compare_snapshots`); ADR-037 D10.1 |
| `import-cycle-growth` | ERROR | No *unapproved* strongly-connected-component growth within `abicheck/` — not literally "no import cycles": a large, deliberately-baselined CLI-registration SCC already exists and is allowed (`IMPORT_CYCLE_ALLOWLIST`). The invariant is that no *new* module joins it and no *new* separate SCC forms; extending the allowlist to unblock a fresh cycle needs an ADR or explicit architectural sign-off, not a routine edit (CLAUDE.md "M1-3") |
| `mypy-baseline` | ERROR if drifted up | mypy error count ≤ documented baseline |
| `examples-ground-truth` | ERROR | Every `examples/case*/` has a `README.md` and an entry in `ground_truth.json` |
| `examples-readme-sync` | ERROR | `examples/README.md` headline count, verdict distribution, and case-index rows match `ground_truth.json` (catches missing/stale catalog rows) |
| `mkdocs-nav-coverage` | WARN | Every `docs/**/*.md` is in `mkdocs.yml` nav or linked from another doc |
| `adr-index-nav-sync` | ERROR | Every `docs/contribute/adr/*.md` is linked from `adr/index.md`, and the ADR index page itself (not each individual ADR — relaxed, since that overloaded top-level nav with 50+ flat entries for no reader benefit) is listed in `mkdocs.yml`'s nav, so every ADR stays reachable from published navigation (this is what originally caught ADR-041 going missing from nav despite being accepted). Also requires every ADR to carry a Status metadata line/heading, and an ADR whose status leads with "Superseded" to link to its replacement |
| `banned-imports` | ERROR | No `print(...)` outside CLI/reporter modules; no `subprocess(..., shell=True)` |
| `license-header` | WARN | Every `abicheck/**/*.py` carries the Apache-2.0 header / SPDX identifier |
| `test-assertion-density` | WARN | Every `test_*` function asserts something (directly or via a same-file helper) — flags zero-assertion smoke tests so coverage isn't "filled" without verification |

Run locally: `python scripts/check_ai_readiness.py`. Errors fail; warnings print and pass.

## Test-quality gates (beyond line coverage)

Line coverage measures *reach*, not whether a test actually checks the result.
Several mechanisms guard test quality so coverage can't be "filled" without verifying behaviour:

- **FP-rate gate** — `scripts/check_fp_rate.py` (mirrored in `tests/test_fp_rate_gate.py`).
  A labelled corpus of `(old, new)` snapshot pairs run under public-surface scoping:
  internal-noise cases must stay non-breaking (no false positives), real-break cases
  must stay breaking (no false negatives). Both baselines are 0; grow the corpus only
  with cases the correct implementation already passes. Cases carry a scoping *axis*
  tag (`CASE_CATEGORY`); `--markdown`/`--json` emit a per-axis FP/FN breakdown for trend
  tracking.
- **Per-tier accuracy gate** — `scripts/check_tier_accuracy.py` (mirrored in
  `tests/test_tier_accuracy_gate.py`). Complements the FP-rate gate by measuring *what
  each evidence level buys*: one labelled change per case is projected down to what each
  tier observes (L0 symbols → L1 debug → L2 headers → L3 build) and run through `compare`;
  verdicts collapse to a 3-band ordinal (non-breaking/risk/breaking). It records, per
  tier, over-calls (false positives) vs under-calls (false negatives) — encoding the
  principle that **adding a layer reduces both** (L1 sees layout but over-calls internal
  churn; L2 scoping removes it; L0/L1 under-call breaks only headers/build see). Gates on
  top-tier correctness + under-call monotonicity (more evidence never hides a break an
  earlier tier caught — authority rule). CI posts the matrix to the step summary. User
  docs: `docs/learn/evidence-and-detectability.md` § "What each layer buys".
- **Mutation testing** — `scripts/check_mutation_score.py` + `.github/workflows/mutation.yml`.
  `mutmut` mutates the detector core (`diff_*`, `checker_policy`); a *surviving* mutant
  is a covered-but-unverified line. Runs weekly / on the `mutation` PR label, gating on a
  survivor baseline (`SURVIVOR_BASELINE`) once the first run establishes it.
- **Metamorphic property tests** — `tests/test_detector_properties.py` (`slow`).
  Hypothesis-generated snapshot pairs checked against invariants that hold for *any*
  input (idempotence, determinism, direction-symmetry of touched symbols, emitted-kind
  partition, additive monotonicity) — generalization guards, not example-shaped tests.
- **Silent-skip guard** — `tests/conftest.py`. A marker lane can export
  `ABICHECK_MIN_EXECUTED=<n>`; the session fails unless at least `<n>` tests actually ran,
  so a missing external tool can't turn a lane green with zero work done. Wired into the
  `abicc`, `libabigail`, and `integration` CI lanes.

## Line-coverage floor

The `pr` profile's `unit-pr` step (`scripts/verify.py`) enforces a **95%**
line+branch coverage floor (`--cov-fail-under=95`) — the `fast` profile does
not, since it's the everyday inner loop and deliberately skips coverage
instrumentation. This floor applies **only on the canonical Linux/Python-3.13
unit-test lane** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — that's where the full unit
suite runs under coverage.
The other Linux Pythons (3.12/3.14) run the same suite *without* coverage (they would
only re-check the identical floor, and coverage instrumentation adds ~60% wall time).
macOS/Windows skip the Linux-only ELF/DWARF parsing tests, which structurally lowers
their coverage (~93% on macOS), so those lanes run the same tests without the
fail-under gate (macOS still emits a coverage report). Coverage uses the
`sys.monitoring` backend (`COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`, Python 3.12+) to keep the
instrumentation cheap. If the macOS lane ever fails on coverage, the fix is to keep the
gate Linux-scoped — **do not lower the global 95% floor** to make another platform pass.

## Files that are large — edit carefully

**Don't trust hard-coded line counts — they drift.** The AI-readiness gate is the
source of truth: it WARNs on any file >1500 lines and ERRORs >2000 (hard cap, no
allowlist). To see today's large files, run:

```bash
python scripts/check_ai_readiness.py 2>&1 | grep "exceeds soft limit"
```

As of this writing the WARN set (>1500 lines) is `cli.py`, `dumper.py`, and
`buildsource/crosscheck.py` — the main CLI, binary-metadata extraction, and the
cross-check engine. Treat that command output (not this sentence) as current.

When editing any large file, read the specific section you need rather than the
whole file. Several big commands have already been split into sibling
`cli_<name>.py` / `diff_*` modules (see the module map above); prefer extending a
split-out module over growing the parent toward the cap.

### Adding a new top-level command

**First, ask whether it should be a *root* command at all (ADR-043/ADR-054).**
The public root surface is exactly `dump`, `compare`, `scan`, `deps`, `compat`,
`aggregate`, `project` — and `tests/test_cli_root_surface.py` pins that set as
an executable contract, so a new root registration fails CI until the test is
updated too. Before adding one, a new root command must clear **every** one of
these (ADR-054's admission bar — the same review that consolidated four
G30/ADR-047 root groups, one added per artifact, back into the single
`project` group below):

1. It answers a stable, user-facing question — not "here is JSON artifact X,
   let me expose the function that reads/writes it."
2. Its operand is a domain object a user already thinks in terms of (a
   binary, a set of reports, a project config) — not an internal pipeline
   transport format (a manifest, a projection of another artifact).
3. It is useful outside one specific CI Action's wire format. A command whose
   whole job is "shape this JSON exactly how `actions/foo`'s one input
   expects it" is a library function that Action/workflow calls directly
   (`python3 -c "from abicheck.x import y; ..."`), not CLI surface — see
   `abicheck/buildsource/baseline_publish.py`'s `derive_baseline_libraries()`
   for the pattern (used by `publish-baseline.yml`/`update-main-baseline.yml`,
   never a CLI command).
4. It doesn't already fit naturally as an option or subcommand of an existing
   durable operation (`--dry-run`, a new `<verb> <noun>` subcommand under an
   existing group) — a second, parallel "preflight" vocabulary next to an
   already-established one (`dump --dry-run`) is exactly the drift ADR-050's
   `plan --dump-manifest` command caused before ADR-054 folded it back into
   `dump --dump-manifest --dry-run`.
5. It has a real, validated usage scenario beyond the PR that introduced it —
   not just "this pipeline stage produces an artifact, so it should be
   inspectable."
6. Landing it means updating `tests/test_cli_root_surface.py`, this file,
   `README.md`, and `docs/reference/cli-reference.md`
   (`python scripts/gen_cli_reference.py`) in the *same* PR — a root surface
   change with only the test updated (or only the code) is how ADR-043's
   "nothing else is registered" invariant drifted from the actual command set
   before (the CLI carried ten root commands while `README.md` still said
   six).

**If it's advanced multi-target/CI-integration surface that fails the "user
already thinks in terms of this operand" bar (#2) on its own** — validating a
project's `.abicheck.yml`, a `build-output.json`, or generating a run-plan —
it almost certainly belongs as a new subcommand of the existing `project`
group (`abicheck/cli_project.py`), not a new root command. `project` exists
precisely to hold this class of operation: `project validate`,
`project validate-build`, `project plan` are all "read one project-integration
artifact, report on it" operations that share one advanced/opt-in namespace
instead of each claiming root. Add `@project_group.command("your-verb")`
there and extend `tests/test_cli_root_surface.py`'s existing assertions
(which don't need to change, since `project`'s subcommand set isn't pinned
the way the root set is) plus a `TestProjectYourVerbCli`-shaped test class.

Once a root command genuinely clears the bar above, pick the right home:

- **Small command (one function, no significant helpers)** — add to `cli.py` directly with `@main.command(...)`.
- **Larger command or command group** — add as a sibling `abicheck/cli_<name>.py` module:
  1. Top of module: `from .cli import main` (and any shared `_helpers`).
  2. Decorate with `@main.command("foo")` or `@main.group("foo")` as usual.
  3. At the bottom of `cli.py`, add `cli_<name>` to the side-effect `from . import (...)` block — that runs after `main` and helpers are defined, registering the new command.
  4. If the new module uses `@click` decorators, add `abicheck.cli_<name>` to the `disallow_untyped_decorators = false` override in `pyproject.toml` (alongside the existing entries).
  5. If `scripts/check_ai_readiness.py` flags a cycle, this is `IMPORT_CYCLE_ALLOWLIST`'s known CLI-registration cluster — see "What NOT to do" below before extending it.
  6. **Shared utility flags go through a decorator, not an inline copy.** `-v/--verbose` is `@verbose_option`, `--format`/`-o/--output` are `output_options(...)`, language is `lang_option(...)` (all in `cli_options.py`). Every visible option must carry `help=` text and a shared concept must use one canonical primary spelling — both are enforced by `tests/test_cli_contract.py` (`test_no_option_has_empty_help`, `test_shared_concept_canonical_spelling`).
  7. **Moving helpers out of a module that re-exports them?** If you relocate a helper that an existing module re-exports "for API stability / tests" (e.g. the `cli_buildsource` block), preserve the old import path with a lazy module-level `__getattr__` shim that resolves via `importlib.import_module` — a static `from .new_module import …` re-export would re-introduce the import cycle the split was meant to avoid (see the shim at the tail of `cli_buildsource.py`).

## Known gaps — acknowledged remaining work

- **Depth contract, CLI vs. API/MCP — re-investigated for G30, closed as
  stale, not implemented (CLAUDE.md "M1-6").** This entry previously said PR
  #601 (which adds a hard-fail `DumpDepthNotSatisfiedError` when an explicit
  `dump --depth` isn't actually reached, in `cli.py`/`cli_dump_helpers.py`)
  was still open, and that `abicheck/service.py`'s `ScanRequest`/
  `run_scan_subprocess` and `abicheck/mcp_server.py`'s MCP tools needed the
  same check extended to them once it merged. PR #601 merged 2026-07-19.
  Re-checking what "extend the same check" would actually mean turned up two
  separate findings, both closing this gap rather than giving it new code:
  1. `check_requested_depth_satisfied` (the strict gate PR #601 added) is
     called from exactly one place, `cli._write_snapshot_output` — reached
     only by the `dump` command and one `cli_buildsource.py` snapshot-writing
     helper. Neither `service.py`'s `run_dump`/`resolve_input` nor the
     `abi_dump` MCP tool accept a `depth`/`sources`/`build-info` parameter at
     all (confirmed by reading both) — there is no service.py/MCP surface
     that promises a depth-qualified persisted snapshot for this gate to
     extend to.
  2. The only place a caller *can* pass an explicit `depth=` through
     `service.py`/MCP is `ScanRequest`/`abi_scan`/`abi_estimate` — and
     `service_scan.run_scan`, the CLI `scan` command
     (`cli_scan.py`), and the MCP `abi_scan` tool all call the exact same
     `scan_engine.run_scan_core`, so they already share one evidence-contract
     implementation (`_check_scan_evidence_contract`'s pinned-depth
     `_EvidenceContractError`, ADR-037 D5) — there was never a CLI-vs-API/MCP
     disparity on the `scan` side to close, before or after PR #601.
  `_validate_public_depth`'s docstring in `mcp_server.py` carried the same
  stale "PR #601 open, tracked as remaining work" wording and was corrected
  alongside this entry.

- **Action pinning is deliberately partial, not a full sweep.** Third-party
  GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/agentready.yml`, `ci.yml` (the
  `id-token: write` jobs), `pages.yml`, `publish.yml`, and `security.yml` are
  pinned to a full commit SHA (with a `# <tag>` comment) rather than a
  mutable tag/branch — those five carry `security-events:write`,
  `pull-requests:write`, `contents:write`, or `id-token:write` (OIDC/PyPI
  Trusted Publishing), so a re-pointed tag there is a real supply-chain risk.
  The root `action.yml` (the composite Action third-party repos consume
  directly) is pinned the same way, for the same reason: its final step
  conditionally runs `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` under whatever
  `security-events: write` permission the *consuming* workflow grants it, so
  it carries the same blast radius as the elevated-permission workflows
  above even though this repo's own CI doesn't invoke it with that scope.
  Other workflows (`test-action.yml`, `eval-suite.yml`, `performance.yml`,
  `realworld-validation.yml`, `dependency-review.yml`, and any future ones)
  still use tags — deliberately deferred, since they only run with
  `contents: read` and don't touch secrets/publishing/security-event write
  access, so the blast radius of a compromised tag there is far smaller.
  Extend the same pinning to a workflow only when it gains elevated
  permissions, not preemptively.
- **CODEOWNERS risk tiers currently all resolve to one person.** The file is
  structured by risk tier (CRITICAL/HIGH/STANDARD) so a second maintainer
  can be slotted into CRITICAL/HIGH without restructuring, but there is
  only one maintainer today — don't read the tiering as "these are reviewed
  by different people," it isn't, yet.
- **Toolchain-profile compiler-family rendering — audited, `args` trust
  boundary hardened; the `-stdlib=`/`--target=` "fix" itself was wrong and
  has been reverted.** An external audit found `run_plan.py`'s
  `_compose_gcc_options()` composing `-stdlib=`/`--target=` unconditionally
  for any `profiles.<id>.compile` overlay, even when
  `compile.compiler_family: gcc` — both are Clang-driver-only spellings a
  real GCC binary rejects (confirmed against GCC 14.2), so an early pass
  dropped both whenever `compiler_family` resolved to a GCC family name. A
  later review round found that fix backwards: the composed string this
  function returns is **never actually fed to a literal GCC binary
  anywhere in this pipeline** — `--ast-frontend` only has
  `auto`/`castxml`/`clang`/`hybrid` (no `gcc`); castxml's own frontend is
  always its internal bundled Clang (`--castxml-cc-<id>` selects an
  *emulation* mode, not a literal execution path); and the direct-clang
  backend's `_resolve_clang_bin` (`dumper_clang.py`) explicitly rejects a
  `gcc-path` that isn't clang-family and falls back to host
  `clang`/`clang++`. Since the real consumer is always Clang, dropping
  `--target=` actively broke cross-compilation-target correctness for the
  direct-clang backend — it was the *only* signal available there to steer
  parsing away from the host architecture (no "probe the real compiler"
  auto-discovery step exists on that path the way castxml has one), so a
  GCC-family profile with an explicit `target:` would silently have its
  headers parsed for the runner's architecture instead. Reverted:
  `_compose_gcc_options()` emits `-stdlib=`/`--target=` unconditionally
  again, same as before the original audit, with both the change and the
  reasoning for reverting it recorded in the function's own docstring so a
  future reader doesn't rediscover and re-"fix" the same false positive.
  The same original audit flagged a real trust-boundary gap in
  `profiles.<id>.compile.args`, which is unaffected by this revert and
  stays fixed: the existing whitespace-
  smuggling check (`_safe_profile_atom`) rejected one YAML scalar expanding
  into multiple argv tokens, but not a single, whitespace-free dangerous
  atom. `_DANGEROUS_ARG_PREFIXES` (`project_targets.py`) now blocks four
  families of these: direct code-loading flags (`-Xclang`, `-load`,
  `-fplugin=`, `-fpass-plugin=`), file/argv re-expansion (`@response-file`,
  Clang's `--config`/`--config=`), driver command-line substitution
  (`-specs=`/`--specs=`, `-wrapper`), and — added across two follow-up
  review rounds on the same PR, since each is the same underlying
  "opaque subprocess-forwarding" mechanism as the others — GCC's
  `-Wa,`/`-Wp,`/`-Wl,` (comma-joined payload passed straight to the
  assembler/preprocessor/linker; `-Wp,-fplugin=./evil.so` reaches cc1 the
  same as a bare `-fplugin=`, `-Wl,-plugin=./evil.dso` loads an LTO linker
  plugin) and Clang's `-Xpreprocessor`/`-Xassembler`/`-Xlinker`
  (separate-argument equivalent of `-Xclang`). A third review round found a
  deeper issue than another missing flag spelling: every `compile.*` atom
  (not just `args`) now also rejects quote (`'`/`"`) and backslash (`\`)
  characters, since `_compose_gcc_options` space-joins every field into one
  string that `dumper.py`'s `--gcc-options` handling later re-splits with
  `shlex.split()` — an atom like `"'-fplugin=./evil.so'"` starts with a
  quote, not `-fplugin=`, so the prefix denylist alone accepted it, but
  POSIX shlex quote-removal reconstitutes the exact blocked flag on
  re-split (confirmed with an actual `shlex.split()` round-trip). Two more
  review rounds each found a flag real for the mechanism it names but
  empirically NOT exploitable through abicheck's actual pipeline —
  verified rather than taken on faith, and blocked anyway since doing so
  is free: `--castxml-cc-` (a second occurrence naively looks like it
  could replace the trusted `--castxml-cc-<id> <path>` pair
  `dumper_ast_config.py` composes ahead of `args`, but real castxml
  0.6.3 hard-rejects any repeated `--castxml-cc-*` occurrence at
  argv-parse time instead of silently substituting the compiler); and
  `-B<dir>`/`-B <dir>` (GCC's compiler-component search path override
  really does let a planted `cc1`/`cc1plus` run instead of the real one,
  confirmed against real GCC — but every consumer of this composed
  string is Clang, not GCC, and Clang re-execs itself via `-cc1` rather
  than spawning a separate, `-B`-discoverable one; confirmed neither
  castxml's internal bundled Clang nor the direct `--ast-frontend clang`
  backend ran a planted `cc1` with `-B` set). A fifth review round found a
  flag family that IS actually exploitable through this pipeline, unlike
  the two immediately above: clang-cl's (Clang's MSVC-compatible driver
  mode — reachable via a `compile.binding` whose path stem contains
  "clang", e.g. `clang-cl`/`clang-cl.exe`, which
  `dumper_clang._is_clang_family_binary` recognizes as clang-family)
  `/clang:<arg>` escape hatch forwards an argument straight to the
  underlying clang driver, bypassing clang-cl's MSVC-shaped option parsing
  entirely — empirically confirmed exploitable: `clang
  --driver-mode=cl "/clang:-fplugin=./evil.so" -c t.h` really does load and
  run the planted plugin. `/link <options>` (clang-cl's documented
  "forward options to the linker") is blocked alongside it on the same
  LTO-linker-plugin grounds as the already-blocked `-Wl,`, without a
  from-scratch empirical repro of that specific sub-case. A sixth review
  round found a different shape of finding again: `-cc1`/`-cc1as`, Clang's
  internal frontend mode, only activates when `-cc1`/`-cc1as` is literally
  the *first* argument after the program name (confirmed empirically:
  `-cc1` anywhere else is rejected as "unknown argument", including right
  after a leading `-I`) — but `dumper.py`'s `_build_clang_header_command`
  builds argv as `[cc_bin, *-I dirs, --sysroot, -nostdinc, *gcc_options
  tokens, ...]`, so a scan with no `extra_includes`/`sysroot`/`nostdinc`
  lets a leading `-cc1` in `compile.args` genuinely land in that
  first-argument slot. Once in cc1 mode, `-load`/`-fpass-plugin=` were
  already blocked, but cc1 mode exposes an entirely different, much larger
  argument namespace this denylist was never designed to enumerate — Codex
  found `-fcas-plugin-path` (a cc1-only flag not present in every Clang
  build) doing the identical thing. Rejected the mode switch itself rather
  than chasing individual cc1-only flags, the same reasoning as `--config`.
  This denylist is necessarily reactive to the delivery *mechanism*, not exhaustive over
  every dangerous flag a mechanism could carry — a real fix for the
  whack-a-mole shape of this (an allowlist of known-safe ABI flags instead
  of a denylist of known-dangerous ones) was suggested during review but
  deliberately not done here: `args` is documented as a general escape
  hatch for ABI-relevant flags this codebase cannot enumerate a priori
  (GCC/Clang/MSVC each have their own vocabulary), and a strict allowlist
  would need that vocabulary built out first — its own scoped project, not
  a reactive expansion of this fix. (A fourth review round briefly caught a
  correctness gap in a since-reverted sentinel the family-aware
  `_compose_gcc_options()` fix needed — moot now that the fix itself is
  reverted, see above; not detailed here since it no longer applies to any
  code that ships.) Still **not** implemented, and out of
  scope for that fix (each needs its own
  scoped design, not a drive-by extension of the same narrow correction):
  a real toolchain-identity probe that validates a resolved `binding`'s
  actual compiler family/version/target against the profile's declared
  constraints (`compiler_version` is still parsed but never checked against
  anything); a profile-specific AST frontend (there is still only one
  global `--ast-frontend`); and a genuine family-specific argv resolver —
  in particular MSVC `/std:`/`/D` spellings, which this fix does not
  attempt (no `compiler_family: msvc` caller/test exists yet to validate
  against, and a wrong guess here is worse than the pre-existing gap).
- **Deferred entirely, not attempted this pass** (heavier structural
  changes, each needing its own scoped design rather than a drive-by
  addition):
  - *Devcontainer image* — a maintained `.devcontainer/` needs a decision on
    which system tools (castxml, libabigail, abi-compliance-checker,
    compilers) ship baked-in vs. installed on first use, and upkeep as those
    pins drift; `pixi` (see CONTRIBUTING.md) already solves the "one command
    gets you a working dev environment" problem this would target, without
    the image-maintenance burden.
  - *Trend-reporting database* — persisting `scripts/check_tier_accuracy.py`
    /`check_fp_rate.py`/mutation-score history across runs (rather than each
    CI run only gating against a static baseline) needs a storage decision
    (artifact-based vs. external DB) and a retention/access policy before
    it's worth building.
  - *Full behavioral baseline* — `agent-evals/` (this pass, M1-5) is a real
    but minimal harness with one task; a "full behavioral baseline" implies
    a broad task suite plus a scoring/leaderboard story, which should grow
    from real usage of the one-task harness rather than being speculatively
    built out now.
- **Evidence-provider model — investigated, found not to reproduce as
  described; no fix applied.** A status-review follow-up asked whether
  `evidence_status_for_result`'s report-level downgrade (kind-level
  `ARTIFACT_PROVEN` → `UNATTRIBUTED` only when `DiffResult.evidence_tiers`
  is header-only for the *whole* comparison) can let an individual
  header-derived `BREAKING_KINDS` finding read as artifact-proven merely
  because *some other, unrelated* part of the same report had binary
  evidence. Traced this for the highest-stakes family it could apply to —
  layout findings (`TYPE_SIZE_CHANGED`/`TYPE_ALIGNMENT_CHANGED`,
  `diff_types.py`) — and it does not hold up: (1) the direct-clang L2
  backend's `RecordType.size_bits`/`alignment_bits` are populated **only**
  when `dumper_layout_backfill.backfill_dwarf_layout()` actually
  corroborates them against real DWARF (`model.py`'s own
  `dwarf_layout_coherence` docstring) — with no DWARF to backfill against,
  those fields stay `None` and `_append_type_size_and_alignment_changes`'s
  own `is not None` guard means no finding is even emitted, so an
  "unconfirmed clang-derived layout finding" cannot occur; (2) the castxml
  backend computes struct layout itself, via its own bundled real compiler
  targeting the resolved ABI — `model.py` already documents this as
  deliberately treated as sufficient L2 evidence ("trivially self-consistent
  by construction", not needing DWARF corroboration), a prior, intentional
  design decision this pass would have to *overturn*, not merely patch.
  The one place this class of risk is genuinely live is exactly the
  already-tracked toolchain-identity-probe gap above (castxml/clang invoked
  with compiler/ABI flags that don't match the real build) — not a separate
  evidence-status bug. A **real** per-finding provider model (recording,
  per `Change`, which of L0–L5 actually produced/corroborated it) would
  need new provenance plumbing through all ~45 `Change(...)` construction
  sites across `diff_*.py`/`buildsource/*.py`, each individually verified
  against the FP-rate/mutation-score gates — a multi-day project on its
  own, not attempted here.
- **Type reachability (direct vs. transitive stdlib references) — computed
  and wired into `diff_types.py`'s RecordType-based detectors; enum/typedef
  paths remain unwired.** `abicheck/type_reachability.py`
  (`directly_referenced_stdlib_types()`) computes, from a snapshot alone,
  which `std::`/`__gnu_cxx::`/etc. record types are directly referenced by
  a non-stdlib function's signature or a non-stdlib type's own field — as
  opposed to only reachable via deep template-instantiation internals
  (`std::string::_Alloc_hider`, `std::_Rb_tree_node_base`) that
  `is_non_abi_surface_type`'s existing whole-name-prefix filter already
  correctly excludes as toolchain-artifact churn either way. A Codex review
  round found and fixed a real correctness gap in the computational claim:
  candidate identification originally matched only `RecordType.name`, but
  castxml/direct-clang populate the bare leaf there and the
  namespace-qualified spelling separately in `qualified_name` (`model.py`,
  `dumper_clang.py`) — so `name` alone never carries a `std::` prefix for
  those two backends and the helper silently found nothing on any real
  castxml/clang-produced snapshot. Fixed by identifying candidates via
  `qualified_name or name`. That fix alone was still insufficient, confirmed
  by dumping a real compiled `std::vector<int>` parameter end to end:
  `Function.return_type`/`Param.type` spell the outer type **bare**
  (`"vector<int, std::allocator<int> >"`) even when the matching
  `RecordType`'s identity is fully qualified
  (`"std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >"`), across *all three* backends
  (DWARF bakes the qualified form straight into `name` with no separate
  field; castxml/clang keep `name` bare and `qualified_name` separate) — so
  a pure full-identity substring match still couldn't connect the two.
  Fixed by also generating a namespace-prefix-stripped spelling per
  candidate and matching against either form. **Since resolved** (a later
  pass, user-requested): a signature spelled with a typedef alias
  (`std::string`, `std::wstring`, ...) names the alias, not the real
  underlying class (`std::basic_string<char, ...>`) that owns the
  `RecordType` entry — no current model field maps one back to the other
  directly, but `snapshot.typedefs` does carry the alias → target mapping.
  Verified empirically against a real DWARF-dumped `std::string`
  parameter: `snapshot.typedefs["std::string"]` resolves to the bare
  `"basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >"`,
  while the owning `RecordType.name` is the fully-qualified
  `"std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>,
  std::allocator<char> >"` — libstdc++ wraps its own post-C++11 dual-ABI
  types in an inline namespace (`__cxx11::`) the exact same way libc++
  wraps its whole standard library (`__1::`/`__ndk1::`, already handled),
  so that inline-namespace-stripping list gained a third entry. The
  typedef *key* itself needed the identical bare-vs-qualified treatment
  already applied to `RecordType` identities (the DWARF backend spells the
  signature with the bare form `"string"`, never the qualified typedef key
  `"std::string"`), so `_typedef_spelling_targets()` builds a
  `spelling -> target` index covering both the literal key and its
  namespace-stripped bare form (dropped instead of recorded when
  ambiguous, same false-negative-over-false-positive principle as the
  `RecordType` spelling index), and `_scan()` now follows a matched
  typedef alias to its target the same way `surface.py`'s own
  reachability closure does. What this does *not* cover: a stdlib alias
  the producing backend never emitted into `snapshot.typedefs` at all (no
  empirical case of this found across the three backends so far, but
  nothing guarantees one couldn't exist) — that residual case degrades
  silently back to "not directly referenced," the same conservative
  false-negative default this whole module already uses throughout.

  **Two more real gaps found and fixed in the same pass** (Codex review,
  fresh evidence): (1) the non-stdlib bare-alias fallback derived a
  record's unqualified spelling via `identity.rsplit("::", 1)`, which
  splits inside a *template argument's own* qualified name rather than at
  the outer namespace boundary — for `"api::Wrapper<dep::Tag>"`, the
  lexically last `"::"` belongs to the template argument `dep::Tag`, not
  the outer namespace path, so the old code derived the corrupted bare
  form `"Tag>"` instead of `"Wrapper<dep::Tag>"`, and a real dumper
  backend's bare signature spelling for that wrapper then never matched
  anything. Fixed with a new `_bare_type_name()` that tracks `<`/`>`
  nesting depth and only treats a `"::"` at depth zero as a namespace
  separator. (2) stdlib and non-stdlib spellings were matched via one
  *combined* compiled pattern in a single non-overlapping `finditer()`
  pass — when a non-stdlib record's own identity embeds a stdlib type's
  spelling verbatim (e.g. a template instantiation `"Wrapper<std::string>"`
  registered as its own record identity), and a public signature names
  that wrapper's full identity exactly, the combined pattern's
  longest-first alternation matches the whole wrapper span first,
  consuming it — since regex matches never overlap, the nested
  `"std::string"` substring inside that same span was never independently
  found, even though it is directly present in the public signature text.
  Fixed by splitting `_spelling_index()` into two independent indices
  (stdlib vs. non-stdlib/record) with two independently compiled patterns
  scanned separately over each declaration, so one pattern's match can
  never mask the other's.

  **Wiring (this pass):** `diff_types.py`'s single choke-point gate,
  `_is_abi_surface_type()`, now accepts a `directly_referenced` set (built
  once per detector via `_directly_referenced(old, new)`) and un-filters a
  std:: record that set names, instead of blanket-filtering every std::
  record regardless of direct use. Because every RecordType-based
  struct/union/field/kind/reserved detector in that file already shares this
  one gate function, wiring it there once covers all of them uniformly —
  not 9 independent, individually-drifting call sites. While wiring this in,
  the FP-rate corpus's own new cases (`stdlib-direct-reference` category)
  surfaced a second, *pre-existing* correctness gap in the gate's std::
  check itself (independent of `directly_referenced`): it filtered using
  `_is_non_abi_surface_type(t.name, ...)`, i.e. bare `t.name` only, the exact
  same bare-vs-qualified split as the `type_reachability.py` fix above — so
  a real castxml/clang-produced std:: record (bare `name`, qualified
  `qualified_name`) was **never actually filtered as std:: at all**,
  independent of whether anything referenced it. Fixed in the same gate by
  keying the std:: prefix check on `qualified_name or name` (the anonymous-
  type-marker half of the check still uses bare `name`, unaffected).
  `diff_platform.py`/`diff_symbols.py`/`diff_vtable_layout.py`/
  `diff_stdlib_impl.py`/`diff_layout.py`/`diff_filtering.py`/
  `diff_type_spellings.py`, plus `diff_types.py`'s own enum/typedef paths
  (which call `is_non_abi_surface_type`/`is_abi_surface_type_name` directly
  on enum/typedef names, not through `_is_abi_surface_type`), remain
  unwired and carry the identical bare-name gap — each needs its own
  individually-verified follow-up (FP-rate/mutation-score gates), not a
  drive-by extension of this pass's RecordType-scoped fix.

## What NOT to do

- Don't hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## [Unreleased]` section directly — add a `changelog.d/` fragment instead (see Conventions above); CI enforces this
- Don't modify `examples/` test cases without understanding the ground truth they encode
- Don't add dependencies without strong justification (this is a lightweight tool)
- Don't skip test markers — if a test needs `castxml`, mark it `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Don't "fix" the mypy errors listed above by adding `# type: ignore` broadly
- Don't modify binary test fixtures without regenerating expected outputs
- Don't change public API signatures without checking for breaking changes
- Don't add platform-specific code without considering cross-platform compatibility
- Don't extend `IMPORT_CYCLE_ALLOWLIST` in `scripts/check_ai_readiness.py` to make a new cycle pass, and never as a routine step to unblock CI. The existing large CLI/service entry documents an accepted, by-design registration pattern (Click sibling commands registering back on `cli.main`) — a *new* member outside that documented pattern is very likely a real dependency-direction problem, not another instance of it. Prefer a function-local import or moving the shared logic to a leaf module both sides can depend on. If the coupling really is intentional, extending the allowlist needs an ADR (or explicit maintainer sign-off) recorded in the PR, the same bar as any other architectural exception — not a comment justifying it inline and moving on.
- Don't hand-duplicate a command, invariant, or count from this file into an adapter (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/`) — point the adapter back here instead (see the table at the top of this file).
