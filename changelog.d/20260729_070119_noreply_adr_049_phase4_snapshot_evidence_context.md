### Added

- **ADR-049 Phase 4: `contract_evidence`/`evaluation_context`/`decision_receipt`
  snapshot block shapes** — new `abicheck.contract_evidence` module defines
  the frozen, order-independent dataclasses for a persisted snapshot's
  policy-independent evidence (`ContractEvidenceBlock`), policy-dependent
  resolved configuration (`EvaluationContextBlock`), and per-finding
  relevance decisions (`DecisionReceiptBlock`), each carrying its own schema/
  evaluator/identity-algorithm version counter. `check_persisted_context_versions_supported()`
  fails closed on any version newer than currently supported while allowing
  a mixed-version context (older evidence re-evaluated against a newer
  policy). Not yet wired into snapshot persistence — shape only, matching
  the Phase 0/1 rollout precedent.
