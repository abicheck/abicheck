### Removed

  `--policy-file`.

### Fixed

- **C++20 detection now recognizes parenthesized `#if (0)`/`#elif (1)`
  and the no-parens `#if defined __cplusplus` spellings.** Both are valid,
  equally common C/C++ preprocessor syntax — a parenthesized literal is
  the same guard as the bare spelling, and `defined X` is equivalent to
  `defined(X)` — but neither was recognized by the always-false/
  always-true/always-reachable guard patterns, so headers using either
  form could still be wrongly forced into (or kept out of) C++20 mode.
