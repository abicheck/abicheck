  whom, and why it matters. Backtick identifiers like `ChangeKind` or
  `--policy-file`.

### Fixed

- **The native gcc header plugin records base access and byte-aligned
  bit-fields** — it now emits each base's access specifier, so
  `base_class_access_narrowed` fires at gcc-plugin headers depth too, and it
  reads `DECL_C_BIT_FIELD` instead of `DECL_BIT_FIELD`, which GCC clears for a
  bit-field that happens to sit on a byte boundary (`unsigned a : 8`), so a
  bit-field becoming a plain member now reports `field_bitfield_changed`.

### Performance

  A baseline stored by the plugin before extractor generation 60 compared
  with a newer snapshot shows that difference as `field_bitfield_changed`;
  it is annotated `COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK` ("extractor-generation drift;
  re-dump baseline") instead of reading as a break.
