### Added

- **`release_recommendation` gains `possible_impact`** (schema 2.22): a new,
  always-non-null string field carrying the bump abicheck would recommend if
  its evidence were sufficient to confirm one. `version_bump` stays `null`
  when `state` is `"unavailable"` (the honesty fix from earlier in this PR),
  but that previously left the still-plausible bump readable only from
  free-text `rationale` prose — `possible_impact` gives automation a
  machine-readable answer to "what would this be if confirmed?" without
  reintroducing the blind-trust risk `version_bump: null` exists to prevent
  (an automated release action must still gate on `version_bump`/`state`,
  never on `possible_impact` alone).
- **`aggregate --format json`/text output gains a `profile_matrix`** (schema
  1.1): a project running the same target under multiple toolchain profiles
  (`profiles:` in `.abicheck.yml`, `check_id` shaped
  `target@profile#baseline_channel@requested_depth` per ADR-047 §7) previously
  saw unrelated-looking `target_id` rows in `targets[]` with nothing tying
  them back to the same logical target. `TargetReport` gains `profile_id`/
  `base_target` (parsed from a `check_id`-shaped `target_id`, via the new
  `parse_check_id()`), and `AggregateResult.profile_matrix` groups every
  target sharing a `base_target` into one entry naming which profiles are
  `affected_profiles` (verdict neither `NO_CHANGE` nor `COMPATIBLE`) versus
  clean — e.g. "libfoo is broken under linux-gcc14/linux-clang20 but fine
  under windows-msvc" instead of three opaque rows. Empty (and every target's
  `profile_id` absent) for a `target_id` with no profile encoding — the
  common single-profile case — so this is purely additive.
