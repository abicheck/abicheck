### Fixed

- **The HTML report never actually demangled C++ symbols, despite
  appearing to support it.** `html_report._symbol_cell` read a
  `demangled_symbol` attribute that `Change` (the real production
  dataclass) never sets, so it silently fell back to the raw mangled
  symbol every time; the Description column's own embedded mangled
  names were never touched at all. `generate_html_report` now accepts
  a `demangle` parameter (default `True`) and demangles both the Symbol
  and Description columns for the native (non-`compat_html`) report --
  always running `demangle.demangle_text()` *before* `html.escape()`,
  so a demangled signature's own `<`/`>`/`&` (from a template argument)
  are escaped like any other text rather than injected raw. `--demangle`/
  `--no-demangle` now covers `--format html` the same way it already
  covered markdown/review; `--format json`/`sarif`/`junit` are
  unaffected and keep raw mangled symbols for downstream tooling.
