### Fixed

- **C++20 detection now applies the `#if __cplusplus < N` polarity fix to
  the `#elif` spelling too.** A pre-C++20 fallback written as a later
  `#elif __cplusplus < N` arm (after an earlier disabled arm) previously
  got the same wrong treatment the opening-`#if` form had — masked as
  circular while the genuinely circular `#else` sibling was trusted —
  since only the `#if`-opening case was fixed. The `#elif` arm now
  settles the chain the same way `#elif 1`/`#elif true` does.
