it should read in CHANGELOG.md. Delete the other sections.

### Fixed

- **Hidden-friend surface classification no longer trusts an ambiguous
  bare-name origin fallback.** When a hidden friend's owner class has no
  recorded `qualified_name` (a producer that doesn't populate it), the
  scoping classifier fell back to a bare-name lookup that merges origins
  across every type sharing that leaf name — so an unrelated *public*
  `Foo` in one namespace could silently mask a genuinely private
  `priv::Foo`'s hidden-friend removal, hiding a real public ADL break.
  The fallback is now skipped (falling through to the friend function's
  own recorded origin instead) whenever the bare name resolves to more
  than one type in the snapshot.
