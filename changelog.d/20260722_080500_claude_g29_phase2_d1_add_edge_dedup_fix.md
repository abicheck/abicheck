### Fixed

- **`SourceGraphSummary.add_edge` now dedups on the role-aware
  `relation_key()` instead of the coarse `(src, dst, kind)` key** (ADR-046
  D1 follow-up): two L5 edges that only differ by role — e.g. a private
  type used as one function's return type and as another's parameter type,
  both `DECL_HAS_TYPE` — previously collapsed into a single `GraphEdge`
  object on ingestion, so `relation_key()` could never actually observe
  both roles from a real graph. Role-distinct edges now persist as separate
  objects with independent evidence.
