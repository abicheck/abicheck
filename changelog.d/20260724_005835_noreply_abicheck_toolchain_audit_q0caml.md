### Fixed

- **Hidden-friend surface scoping now detects bare-name ambiguity across
  record and enum kinds, not just within each kind separately.** A
  private hidden-friend owner record and an unrelated public enum
  sharing a bare name (neither carrying a `qualified_name`) each looked
  unique within their own kind's name map, so the collision went
  undetected even though both share the same `origin_by_key` entry —
  which the public enum then merged to public, silently confirming a
  record owner that is actually private and keeping a hidden friend that
  should have been demoted.
