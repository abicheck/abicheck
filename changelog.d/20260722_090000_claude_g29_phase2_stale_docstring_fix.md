### Fixed

- **`GraphEdge.key()`/`edge_relation_key()` docstrings and ADR-046's "D1
  implementation" section no longer claim `SourceGraphSummary.add_edge`'s
  dedup is unaffected by the role-aware `relation_key()` split** —
  documentation review found these three spots were never updated after a
  same-PR follow-up fix changed exactly that (`add_edge` now dedups on
  `relation_key()`, not the coarse `key()`). No code behavior changes; this
  is a documentation-accuracy fix only.
