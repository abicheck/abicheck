# ADR-045: GitHub Actions Integration Model — Project Lifecycle Over Aggregate-Centric Design

**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Status:** Proposed — not implemented. This ADR records the target domain
model and component surface; `docs/development/plans/g29-github-actions-integration-model.md`
carries the phased backlog that implements it.
**Decision maker:** Nikolay Petrov

---

## Context

ADR-017 chose a composite action as the GitHub Actions delivery mechanism and
has held up structurally. What has drifted is everything *above* that
mechanism: `action.yml` has grown to 51 inputs across five modes, two more
composite actions (`collect-facts`, `baseline`) were added for source
evidence and snapshot production, and `abicheck aggregate` was added as a
fan-in CLI command. Each addition was locally reasonable; the result read
command-first rather than scenario-first — a project owner had to already
know which CLI mode maps to their build before they could pick an Action
input.

This ADR is scoped to the *integration model*: the domain vocabulary, the
component surface, and the artifacts that flow between jobs. It does not
change detector logic, snapshot schemas, or the core `compare`/`scan`/`dump`
CLI semantics.

### What the audit found

Grounded in reading `action.yml`, `action/run.sh`, `actions/collect-facts/`,
`actions/baseline/`, `abicheck/cli_aggregate.py`, `abicheck/aggregate.py`,
and the doc corpus in `docs/user-guide/`:

1. **`abicheck aggregate` is confirmed fan-in-only.** `abicheck/aggregate.py:16-24`
   states it directly: it "does not analyze a binary — it reconciles
   already-produced reports." It combines worst-verdict, each report's own
   pre-computed gate decision, and target-coverage — it never re-runs a
   comparison. There is no `actions/aggregate` composite action; today it's
   invoked as a raw CLI step in recipe docs. This confirms the premise of
   this ADR: aggregate is one scenario (S28 below), not a load-bearing
   abstraction the rest of the model should be built around.

2. **Root `action.yml` has real per-mode input scoping the schema doesn't
   express.** `debug-info1/2`, `devel-pkg1/2`, `dso-only`,
   `include-private-dso`, `keep-extracted`, `fail-on-removed-library`, and
   `jobs` are declared as unconditional top-level inputs but are only
   forwarded by `run.sh` inside the `_is_release_style_operand()` guard
   (`action/run.sh:387-407`) — i.e. only when `old-library`/`new-library` is
   a directory or package, not a single binary pair. `abi-baseline` is
   resolved unconditionally at `run.sh:150-233` but only consumed by
   `compare`/`scan`; setting it on `mode: dump` silently no-ops with no
   warning. `estimate`/`audit` are scan-only aliases declared generically.
   None of this is a bug — `run.sh` comments document the intent, and
   `action.yml`'s `description:` text for every one of these inputs already
   states its scope inline (e.g. `debug-info1`: "compare mode,
   directory/package operands only"; `abi-baseline`: "for compare mode ...
   or scan mode"; `estimate`/`audit`: "scan mode only" — confirmed by
   re-reading `action.yml`). The remaining gap is narrower than a first
   read suggests: there is no *runtime* signal when one of these is set on
   an incompatible mode — a reader who doesn't check the description text
   gets silent no-op behavior instead of a warning. §"P0" in the companion
   plan scopes this correctly as a runtime-validation item, not a
   documentation rewrite.

3. **`collect-facts`'s `phase: auto` doesn't complete for two of three
   producers.** For `producer: wrapper` or `producer: clang-plugin`,
   `phase: auto` silently only runs `prepare` (`actions/collect-facts/run.sh:714-716`)
   — the caller's own build step still has to run before `verify` means
   anything, so `auto` is only actually a single self-contained step for
   `producer: replay`. This is exactly the kind of implicit two-step
   choreography that S8/S9 need to surface explicitly rather than bury in a
   `phase: auto` default.

4. **Documentation is scenario-adjacent but command-organized.** Multi-DSO
   guidance is split three ways (`github-action.md`, `github-action-recipes.md`,
   `github-action-source-scans.md`) with no single canonical page (confirmed by
   research into `docs/user-guide/*`). The L0–L5 evidence-layer table is
   deliberately restated in five places per `docs/CLAUDE.md`'s own note — by
   design, but it means any layer-model or producer change has a five-file
   blast radius. `docs/user-guide/choose-your-workflow.md` is the closest
   existing thing to a scenario front door and is the right foundation to
   build on, not replace.

5. **One real pilot exists with a written validation report:**
   `validation/pvxs-abi-validation-2026-07.md` (epics-base/pvxs, two
   libraries `libpvxs`/`libpvxsIoc`, Make-based build, no compile DB). It
   found and fixed three real defects (an O(N²) perf bug, RTTI-symbol false
   positives, a zero-config `scan --sources` include-dir bug) and ends with a
   recommended two-library `compare` workflow. **No second pilot with an
   equivalent validation report exists.** A repo-wide search for "Vandal"
   returned zero matches, and oneDAL appears only as a scan-timing data point
   (`validation/uxl-scan-levels-timing-2026-06.md`, built from conda-forge
   release binaries — not a submitted integration PR) and as an illustrative
   example in `multi-binary.md`/`scan-levels.md`, never as a named
   pilot-integration write-up. **This ADR treats PVXS as its only confirmed
   pilot and does not fabricate a second one.** §14 records this as an open
   validation gap rather than inventing findings for a repository that
   cannot be located.

---

## Decision

Reorganize the GitHub Actions integration surface around a **project
integration lifecycle** instead of the CLI command set, with `aggregate`
demoted to one terminal fan-in scenario within that lifecycle:

```
project configuration
    → existing or instrumented product build
    → build outputs and evidence
    → target discovery/resolution
    → baseline resolution
    → scan/compare/audit          (per resolved target — this is "check")
    → reporting
    → optional fan-in             (aggregate — only when >1 target)
    → baseline publication/refresh
```

Concretely, this means:

- A stable **domain vocabulary** (§1) that every Action input, schema field,
  and doc page reuses instead of ad hoc terms.
- A small number of **primitives** (existing `collect-facts`/`baseline`,
  plus new `resolve-baseline` and `check-target`) that each do one lifecycle
  step, and **reusable workflows** that compose them for the common
  end-to-end paths (§4).
- A **standardized build-output contract** so "build once, check many
  targets" is a real artifact, not an implicit convention (§2, §5).
- A **baseline lifecycle** with two named channels — release-contract and
  accepted-main — resolved fail-loud, never silently degraded to "no
  baseline = compatible" (§2, §6).
- A **report envelope** that separates compatibility, evidence coverage,
  operational status, and policy-gate decision as four distinct fields, so
  `aggregate` (or any consumer) never has to infer one from another (§7).
- **`.abicheck.yml` gains a portable `targets:`/`profiles:` block**; GitHub
  runner/token/artifact concerns stay in workflow inputs, never migrate into
  the portable config (§3, decision D5 below).

---

## 1. Domain model

| Term | Definition | Where it's new vs. existing |
|---|---|---|
| **Project** | A repository or shipped product containing one or more ABI/API contracts. | Implicit today (= "the repo"); made explicit as the top-level config scope. |
| **Build profile** | One ABI-significant build configuration: OS, arch, compiler/toolchain, C++ ABI/stdlib, debug/release, ISA, feature flags — the axis that makes two binaries comparable or not. | New explicit identity. Today only encoded loosely via directory/matrix-lane naming. |
| **Target** | One independently checkable ABI/API contract — usually one shared library, but also a plugin contract, an app-consumer contract, or a build-wide source audit. | New explicit identity. Today conflated with "library" or "the binary passed to `compare`". |
| **Release bundle** | A set of binaries shipped together with cross-library dependencies — the scope `abicheck compare` (directory/package mode) and `--manifest` bundle analysis already operate on (`docs/user-guide/multi-binary.md`). | Existing capability, newly named distinctly from "multiple independent targets" (S14 vs. S15). |
| **Build output** | The standardized, portable artifact a build publishes: binaries, headers, profile identity, commit identity, toolchain provenance, target mapping, compile DB / source facts, digests. | **New** (§2, §5). Closest existing analog is the ad hoc directory a user points `--library`/`--header` at; this makes it a defined, versioned contract. |
| **Source evidence** | L3/L4/L5 evidence from replay/wrapper/plugin (`abicheck/buildsource/`), either build-wide or target-specific. | Existing (`actions/collect-facts`, ADR-028/030/038); this ADR requires every evidence pack to declare which targets it projects onto (§9 — the S16 boundary). |
| **Baseline channel** | Named lifecycle source of a baseline: `release-contract`, `accepted-main`, `explicit` (tag/version), or `custom`. | Existing informally in `docs/user-guide/baseline-management.md`'s "two kinds of baseline"; made a first-class enum here. |
| **Baseline set** | One atomic manifest + one snapshot per target, for one build profile or release bundle. | **New name** for what `actions/baseline`'s `manifest.json` already produces (`actions/baseline/build_manifest.py`) — no code change, just the vocabulary this ADR standardizes on. |
| **Check** | One application of policy to `target × profile × baseline channel × evidence requirement`. | New unit of accounting — today implicit in "one `compare`/`scan` invocation." |
| **Run plan** | The exact, immutable description of which checks a CI run performs. | **New artifact** (§5) — today implicit in workflow YAML + matrix, not machine-readable. |
| **Report** | The result of one check, carrying full identity (target, profile, candidate, baseline, config, commit, evidence depth) — §7. | Existing JSON report, extended with the identity fields §7 requires. |
| **Fan-in** | Combining multiple reports into one CI status. | Existing (`abicheck aggregate`) — explicitly scoped to S28, not the architecture's center. |

### Why these seven boundaries matter (per the task's explicit ask)

The following are easy to conflate and have different failure semantics — a
design built around `aggregate` naturally collapses several of them into
"multiple reports," which loses the distinction:

1. **Multi-binary bundle analysis** (S14) — one `compare`/`--manifest`
   invocation, one report, cross-library findings. A missing library in the
   bundle is itself a finding.
2. **Multiple independent targets** (S15) — N separate checks, N reports,
   each with its own header/compiler context; one target's failure doesn't
   invalidate another's report.
3. **Multiple build profiles** (S17) — the *same* target checked under
   different profiles; a profile is a baseline-set axis, not a target axis.
4. **Multiple baseline channels** (S21) — the *same* target/profile checked
   against two different baselines answering two different questions
   ("did I break the last release" vs. "did I break what main already
   accepted").
5. **Shared source facts** (S16) — one evidence pack, multiple target
   *projections*; a pack is never automatically "for" every DSO in the repo.
6. **Multiple GitHub Actions jobs** — an orchestration/scaling concern
   (matrix, artifact upload/download), orthogonal to all of the above.
7. **Aggregate report** (S28) — a specific fan-in of items 2–4, needed only
   when more than one check's result must produce one CI status.

## 2. Standardized build output

`abicheck-build/` (versioned artifact directory), producer-agnostic:

```
abicheck-build/
  build-output.json          # schema below
  artifacts/                 # binaries as published by the real build
  headers/                   # public header roots, as-installed layout
  generated-headers/         # codegen/configure output, kept separate from headers/
  evidence/
    compile_commands.json    # if produced
    abicheck_inputs/         # source-facts pack, per ADR-028's inputs-pack protocol
  provenance/                # toolchain version dumps, build logs digest, etc.
```

`build-output.json` (schema `abicheck.build-output/v1`):

```json
{
  "schema": "abicheck.build-output/v1",
  "project": "epics-base/pvxs",
  "head_sha": "b7e2c1a...",
  "source_tree_digest": "sha256:...",
  "profile": {
    "id": "linux-x86_64-gcc13-release",
    "os": "linux", "arch": "x86_64",
    "compiler": {"family": "gcc", "version": "13.2.0"},
    "cxx_abi": "itanium", "stdlib": "libstdc++",
    "config": "release"
  },
  "targets": [
    {
      "id": "libpvxs",
      "binary": "artifacts/lib/libpvxs.so.1.5",
      "public_header_roots": ["headers/pvxs"],
      "compile_context": {"include_dirs": ["headers"], "defines": ["PVXS_ENABLE_EXPERT_API"]},
      "bundle": "pvxs-release",
      "evidence": {"kind": "source-facts", "path": "evidence/abicheck_inputs", "projection": "declared"}
    },
    {"id": "libpvxsIoc", "binary": "artifacts/lib/libpvxsIoc.so.1.5", "...": "..."}
  ],
  "bundles": [{"id": "pvxs-release", "targets": ["libpvxs", "libpvxsIoc"]}],
  "evidence_producer": {"kind": "wrapper", "tool": "abicheck-cc", "version": "0.x.y"},
  "digests": {"artifacts/lib/libpvxs.so.1.5": "sha256:..."},
  "diagnostics": {"warnings": [], "skipped_targets": []}
}
```

Design points:

- **`generated-headers/` is separate from `headers/`** so S10 (codegen) can't
  silently claim a `headers/` root that a plain configure step didn't
  actually populate — the build-output *validator* (§11) treats an empty
  `generated-headers/` root declared non-empty in `build-output.json` as a
  hard validation failure, not a warning.
- **`evidence.projection` is `"declared"` or `"inferred"`.** `"declared"`
  means the build itself asserted this evidence pack belongs to this target
  (e.g. per-target compile DB filtering, or a wrapper invoked once per link
  step); `"inferred"` means abicheck derived it from a build-wide pack via
  TU→target mapping and it carries lower confidence — this is the safe
  default for today's real capability (§9) versus the aspirational full
  model.
- **abicheck does not produce `build-output.json` by building the project.**
  A thin `abicheck build-output emit` helper (new, §11) or direct authoring
  is how a project's existing build (or a CMake/Meson `install` step)
  populates it — this is the mechanism for "build once, scan many" (S3)
  without abicheck ever owning the build.

---

## 3. Project contract: extending `.abicheck.yml`, not inventing a manifest zoo

Four config-surface options were compared (§13, decision D5); the chosen
answer is **B+C hybrid**: `.abicheck.yml` gains a portable
`targets:`/`profiles:`/`baseline:` block (stable, project-owned, checked into
the repo), while GitHub-runner-specific and per-run values (candidate
artifact path, current SHA, gate mode, token) stay as **workflow/Action
inputs**, never migrate into `.abicheck.yml`. This avoids both extremes: a
config file polluted with `runs-on`-flavored values, and a second
un-versioned YAML dialect duplicating what `.abicheck.yml` already owns
(policy, suppression, severity).

```yaml
# .abicheck.yml (excerpt — new top-level keys)
targets:
  libpvxs:
    binary_pattern: "lib/libpvxs.so*"
    public_headers: ["headers/pvxs"]
    bundle: pvxs-release
  libpvxsIoc:
    binary_pattern: "lib/libpvxsIoc.so*"
    public_headers: ["headers/pvxsIoc"]
    bundle: pvxs-release

bundles:
  pvxs-release:
    targets: [libpvxs, libpvxsIoc]

baseline:
  channels:
    release-contract: {source: github-release, asset_pattern: "abicheck-baseline-*.tar.zst"}
    accepted-main: {source: actions-cache, key_prefix: "abicheck-baseline-main"}
```

Naming resolution for the four overloaded "manifest" meanings the task
flags — each keeps one unambiguous name, none is called bare `manifest.json`:

| Concept | Canonical name | Existing artifact it maps to |
|---|---|---|
| Bundle cross-library contract | `bundle-contract.yml` / the existing `--manifest` flag to `compare`/`multi-binary` | Already exists (`docs/user-guide/multi-binary.md`'s `--manifest`); flag name unchanged, doc term clarified. |
| Baseline-set descriptor | `baseline-set.json` | `actions/baseline/build_manifest.py`'s `manifest.json` — renamed in docs/new schema id only, existing filename kept for compat. |
| Aggregate expected-target set | `abicheck aggregate --manifest` (unchanged CLI flag) / doc term "target-manifest" | Existing `cli_aggregate.py` flag. |
| Build evidence pack descriptor | `build-output.json` (§2) | New. |

---

## 4. Component surface

### Low-level primitives (kept, one gains a sibling)

| Action | Responsibility | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `actions/collect-facts` | Prepare/verify source evidence for one producer (replay/wrapper/clang-plugin). Does not decide project topology. | Existing — kept as-is; `phase: auto`'s two-producer partial-completion (finding 3 above) gets a fail-loud diagnostic, not silent truncation (P0 item). |
| `actions/baseline` | Produce one baseline set (snapshot + `baseline-set.json`) from resolved targets. Read-only: never commits/pushes (already true — `actions/baseline/action.yml:6-8`). | Existing — kept as-is; consumes the new `targets:` block from `.abicheck.yml` instead of a flat `libraries:` list where available. |
| `actions/resolve-baseline` | Resolve `channel × target × profile` → one baseline snapshot path, checking schema/digest/config-identity/evidence-producer compatibility; distinguishes not-found / ambiguous / wrong-profile / stale-schema / incompatible-evidence and never turns any of those into a compatibility verdict. | **New** — see rationale below. |
| root `action.yml` | Execute one `compare`/`dump`/`scan`/`deps-tree`/`deps-compare` invocation. | Existing, unchanged surface; input-scoping documentation fixed per finding 2 (P0), not restructured. |
| `actions/check-target` | Compose `resolve-baseline` + root action + `collect-facts` (if evidence required) for **one resolved target**; always emits the report envelope (§7); accepts `gate-mode: local\|deferred\|advisory`. | **New** — the single high-level primitive the task's "smaller surface" option asks to evaluate; adopted (see decision D6). |
| — (no dedicated Action) | Fan-in. | `abicheck aggregate` stays a plain CLI step invoked from the `check-project` reusable workflow (§ below) — a dedicated `actions/aggregate` composite adds no value over one `run:` line, since aggregate's job is a single CLI call with no shell orchestration to hide. |

**Why `resolve-baseline` is a new primitive, not folded into `check-target`
or the root action:** every one of S2/S19/S20/S21's failure modes is a
baseline-resolution failure, and today that logic is inlined and duplicated
inside `action/run.sh:150-233` (the `abi-baseline` resolution block) with no
independent success/failure signal a caller can branch on. Separating it
lets `check-target` treat "baseline not found" as a distinct, typed
condition instead of falling through to whatever `compare`'s own
missing-file error text happens to be.

### Reusable workflows

| Workflow | Composes | Primary scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| `check-single.yml` | `resolve-baseline` → `check-target` (one target, one profile) | S1, S2, S4, S5, S6 |
| `check-project.yml` | consumes a `build-output.json` artifact → dynamic matrix over `targets[]`/`profiles[]` → `check-target` per cell → optional `aggregate` job if `>1` cell | S3, S14 (via one `check-target` call per bundle), S15, S17, S25, S28 |
| `publish-baseline.yml` | build/consume `build-output.json` → `actions/baseline` → upload as release asset (atomic archive, §10) | S19 |
| `update-main-baseline.yml` | same as above, targeting the `accepted-main` channel storage backend, triggered on default-branch push | S20 |

`check-packages.yml` was considered and **rejected as a fifth workflow**
(decision D7): a package/prebuilt-artifact target (S13) is just another
`build-output.json` producer (a thin adapter unpacks RPM/Deb/tar/conda into
the same `artifacts/`/`headers/` layout) — it reuses `check-project.yml`
rather than duplicating matrix/aggregate logic.

Composite Actions structurally cannot create jobs or a dynamic matrix
(confirmed against current `action.yml`/`actions/*/action.yml`, which are
plain `runs.using: composite` — no `jobs:` key is a valid composite-action
key); this is why `check-project.yml` must be a reusable *workflow*, not a
fourth composite action, whenever more than one target/profile is in play.

---

## 5. Run plan

`run-plan.json` (schema `abicheck.run-plan/v1`) — the machine-readable
output of resolving `.abicheck.yml` + dynamic CI inputs into an exact set of
checks, generated once per `check-project.yml` invocation and consumed by
the matrix and by `aggregate`'s `--manifest`:

```json
{
  "schema": "abicheck.run-plan/v1",
  "project": "epics-base/pvxs",
  "head_sha": "b7e2c1a...",
  "checks": [
    {"target": "libpvxs", "profile": "linux-x86_64-gcc13-release",
     "baseline_channel": "accepted-main", "required": true, "evidence_depth": "headers"},
    {"target": "libpvxsIoc", "profile": "linux-x86_64-gcc13-release",
     "baseline_channel": "accepted-main", "required": true, "evidence_depth": "headers"}
  ]
}
```

This is the artifact `check-project.yml`'s matrix step reads to fan out.
**Correction from an earlier draft:** `run-plan.json`'s `checks[]` schema is
*not* wire-compatible with `abicheck aggregate --manifest` as it exists
today — confirmed by reading `abicheck/aggregate.py:753-769`
(`ExpectedTargets.from_manifest_data`), which requires a top-level
`{"targets": [{"id", "required"}]}` shape and raises `AggregateError`
("manifest 'targets' must be a non-empty list") on anything else, including
a `checks[]`-shaped document. `run-plan.json` is deliberately richer than
that format (it carries `profile`/`baseline_channel`/`evidence_depth` per
check, which `aggregate` has no use for — it only needs to know which
target IDs are required). So `check-project.yml`'s aggregate step must
*project* `run-plan.json` down to the existing `{"targets": [...]}` shape
(one line of `jq`/Python, not a CLI change) rather than pass `run-plan.json`
straight through as `--manifest`. This is tracked as an explicit P1.4
sub-task in the companion plan so it isn't lost between "run plan exists"
and "aggregate consumes it." Coverage is still checked against the same
explicit plan, not an implicit job list — the fix is in how the two
artifacts connect, not in the coverage guarantee itself.

---

## 6. Baseline lifecycle

Two named channels, each with distinct semantics (existing informal
distinction in `baseline-management.md`, made structural):

- **`release-contract`** — immutable; built from a shipping-equivalent
  build (ideally the *same* `build-output.json` the release itself
  publishes, not a second divergent build); published as one atomic
  baseline-set archive (`baseline-<profile>.tar.zst` containing
  `baseline-set.json` + one snapshot per target, mirroring the task's
  proposed layout); changes only on release.
- **`accepted-main`** — mutable; refreshed by `update-main-baseline.yml` on
  every default-branch push; answers "did this PR introduce a break vs. what
  main already accepted," never substitutes for `release-contract`.

`resolve-baseline` failure taxonomy (all fail-loud, never silently
degraded to a compatibility verdict):

| Condition | Resolver outcome | What the check does |
|---|---|---|
| No baseline set exists for `channel` yet | `not_found` | Advisory pass with an explicit "no baseline yet" report field — not a compatibility verdict of any kind. |
| Baseline set exists but this target isn't in it | `ambiguous` (target missing from set) | Coverage failure, distinct from a compatibility break. |
| Baseline set is for a different `profile.id` | `wrong_profile` | Hard failure — never silently compare across profiles. |
| `baseline-set.json` schema version newer/older than resolver understands | `stale_schema` | Hard failure with an upgrade-path message. |
| Baseline's `evidence_producer` incompatible with candidate's (e.g. wrapper vs. replay) | `incompatible_evidence` | Hard failure — evidence-producer mismatch is an infrastructure problem, not an ABI finding (S16/S8/S9 boundary). |

---

## 7. Report envelope

Every check's report gains these identity/status fields (existing JSON
report body is additive-compatible — this is new required metadata, not a
schema break to detector output):

```json
{
  "report_schema": "abicheck.report/v1",
  "check_id": "libpvxs@linux-x86_64-gcc13-release#accepted-main",
  "project": "epics-base/pvxs",
  "target": "libpvxs",
  "profile_id": "linux-x86_64-gcc13-release",
  "head_sha": "b7e2c1a...",
  "base_ref": "main",
  "candidate_digest": "sha256:...",
  "baseline_channel": "accepted-main",
  "baseline_digest": "sha256:...",
  "requested_depth": "source",
  "effective_depth": "headers",
  "evidence_coverage": {"state": "degraded", "reasons": ["wrapper_pack_empty_for_target"]},
  "compatibility_verdict": "breaking",
  "policy_gate_decision": "fail",
  "operational_errors": [],
  "tool_version": "abicheck 0.x.y",
  "action_version": "abicheck/abicheck@v1"
}
```

Five axes kept explicitly distinct, per the task's requirement (§11 there):
**compatibility**, **evidence coverage**, **operational status**, **policy
gate**, **report publication**. `requested_depth != effective_depth` is
always surfaced — a request for `source` depth that only achieved `headers`
must never render as an unqualified "source-depth check passed."

`gate-mode` replaces the ad hoc combination of `fail-on-breaking` /
`fail-on-api-break` for the new primitives (root `action.yml`'s existing
flags are kept for backward compatibility — see migration mapping below):

- **`local`** — this one target's check sets the job's own exit code (today's
  root-action behavior; correct for S1/S2/S4/S6).
- **`deferred`** — report is always produced; the *matrix's* final
  `aggregate` job computes gate status. Operational/config errors still fail
  the individual job — `deferred` only defers the *compatibility* verdict's
  effect on exit code, never operational errors (S15/S28).
- **`advisory`** — report published, findings never affect exit code
  (shadow-rollout burn-in, S26).

Migration mapping: `fail-on-breaking: true` + `fail-on-api-break: false`
(root action's current default) ≡ `gate-mode: local` with the existing
severity thresholds unchanged; `check-target`'s `gate-mode` is additive, not
a breaking change to the root action's existing flags.

## 8. Condensed scenario catalog (S1–S28)

Full 15-field cards for all 28 scenarios would run several thousand lines;
this ADR keeps the domain-model decisions above scenario-anchored and
defers exhaustive per-scenario cards (user story, copy-pasteable YAML,
acceptance criteria) to
`docs/development/plans/g29-github-actions-integration-model.md` §Scenario
backlog, where each scenario becomes a tracked, independently
implementable/testable unit. Table below maps each scenario to the primary
workflow/primitive from §4 and its baseline requirement, confirming no
scenario requires `aggregate` except S28.

| # | Scenario | Primary entry point | Baseline | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Single library, committed baseline | `check-single.yml` | explicit (committed file) | Minimal YAML; root action alone suffices, no new primitive needed. |
| S2 | Single library, latest-release baseline | `check-single.yml` | release-contract | Needs `resolve-baseline`'s fail-loud `not_found` handling. |
| S3 | Reuse existing expensive build | `check-project.yml` | either | The `build-output.json` consumer path; no rebuild inside abicheck. |
| S4 | Build+check in one job | `check-single.yml` (local mode) | either | Small-project shortcut; not the default for large repos. |
| S5 | Single-build audit, no baseline | `check-single.yml` (`baseline: none`) | none | Advisory by default (§7 `local` vs `advisory`). |
| S6 | Header-aware compatibility | `check-single.yml` | any | Public-header floor; `evidence_coverage` must confirm header parse reached (finding-driven — no silent L0 fallback). |
| S7 | Source scan via compile-DB replay | `check-single.yml`/`check-project.yml` + `collect-facts producer: replay` | any | PR = changed-TU scope; nightly/release = full unseeded. |
| S8 | Source facts via `abicheck-cc` wrapper | `collect-facts producer: wrapper` (prepare) → real build → (verify) | any | Two-step; `phase: auto` limitation (finding 3) documented, not hidden. |
| S9 | Source facts via Clang plugin | `collect-facts producer: clang-plugin` | any | Opt-in optimization, not onboarding default (LLVM-major coupling). |
| S10 | Generated headers / codegen-before-scan | `build-output.json`'s `generated-headers/` root | any | Empty-but-declared root is a hard validation failure (§2). |
| S11 | Make/EPICS/custom build | `collect-facts producer: wrapper` over Make `CC=`/`CXX=` | any | The PVXS validated path (`validation/pvxs-abi-validation-2026-07.md`). |
| S12 | Bazel/sandboxed build | `build-output.json` populated from `aquery`/declared outputs | any | Sandbox side effects must be declared artifacts, not filesystem scraping. |
| S13 | Package-only / prebuilt artifacts | `check-project.yml` via a package→`build-output.json` adapter | any | No source checkout required; folds into `check-project`, no separate workflow (D7). |
| S14 | Multi-DSO release bundle | one `check-target` over the bundle (directory/`--manifest` compare) | any | One report; distinct from S15. |
| S15 | Multiple independent targets, one build | `check-project.yml` matrix, no fan-in required unless gating jointly | any | oneDAL/PVXS-class; each target keeps its own header/compiler context. |
| S16 | Shared source facts, multiple DSO | `collect-facts` + declared `evidence.projection` in `build-output.json` | any | Safe-model-now vs. full-model documented in §2/§9; never auto-assumed ownership. |
| S17 | Multiple build profiles | multiple `check-project.yml` matrix cells keyed by `profile.id` | per-profile | Which lanes are ABI contracts vs. test-only is an explicit `.abicheck.yml` `profiles:` allowlist, not "every CI lane." |
| S18 | Cross compilation | `build-output.json` authored on build host, `check-target` run offline/elsewhere | any | No host auto-detection of target context; dump-producer and compare are decoupled steps. |
| S19 | Release-contract baseline | `publish-baseline.yml` | — (producer) | See §6. |
| S20 | Accepted-main baseline | `update-main-baseline.yml` | — (producer) | See §6. |
| S21 | Multiple baseline channels at once | two `check-target` calls (same target/profile, different `baseline_channel`) | both | Two distinct `check_id`s in the PR UI, never one ambiguous "ABI Check." |
| S22 | Application compatibility (`--used-by`) | `check-target` with an app-consumer target kind | any | App-scoped verdict kept a distinct report field from the library's own verdict. |
| S23 | Plugin/dlopen/dlsym contract | `check-target` with a contract-file target kind | any | Not a public-header compare; a distinct target type in `.abicheck.yml`. |
| S24 | Dependency/container/rootfs checks | root action `deps-tree`/`deps-compare` modes, unchanged | n/a | Explicitly not modeled as a library baseline scan. |
| S25 | Monorepo / multiple components | `check-project.yml` with changed-component-filtered `run-plan.json` | per-component | Run plan may be filtered by diff, but required-target coverage stays fail-closed (§5). |
| S26 | Shadow rollout / migration from another tool | `check-single.yml`/`check-project.yml` with `gate-mode: advisory` | any | Old tool kept running in parallel until acceptance criteria met; no forced removal. |
| S27 | Intentional breaking change | unchanged check, PR-scoped gate relaxation only | accepted-main updates post-merge | Report stays visible; `release-contract` channel is untouched by the relaxation. |
| S28 | Multi-target fan-out/fan-in | `check-project.yml`'s trailing `aggregate` job | n/a (consumes prior checks) | The only scenario `abicheck aggregate` is the entry point for. |

## 9. Source evidence: safe model now vs. full model later

Per the task's explicit instruction not to assume a shared source surface
belongs to every DSO: this ADR adopts the **safe model now** as the P0/P1
contract and defers the **full model** to P2 (tracked in the companion plan,
§ "P2").

**Safe model (adopt now):** an evidence pack's `abicheck_inputs/` content is
either (a) target-specific (one wrapper/plugin invocation scoped to one
link unit, or a compile-DB filtered to one target's TUs — `projection:
"declared"`), or (b) explicitly build-wide, in which case it feeds only
build-wide source audits (S5-class checks) and per-target *header* scans,
never an unqualified per-target *source*-depth claim. `build-output.json`'s
`evidence.projection` field (§2) is what a target-specific `check-target`
run inspects before claiming `effective_depth: source` in its report (§7).

**Full model (P2, not built here):** TU → object/link-unit → output-DSO
attribution via linker command/output identity, so a build-wide pack can be
safely and automatically projected onto the correct subset of targets.
Requires linker-invocation capture (`abicheck/buildsource/build_query.py`
already has partial zero-config compile-DB inference for CMake/Bazel/Make
this could extend) — scoped as its own follow-up ADR when undertaken, not
retrofitted into this one.

---

## 10. Baseline storage backends compared

| Backend | Atomic set? | Write access needed | Recommended for |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Release asset | Yes (single tarball upload) | `contents: write` on a release, not a branch | `release-contract` (S19) — matches "publish atomically" requirement. |
| Actions cache | Yes (single cache key) | none (cache API only) | `accepted-main` (S20) — cheap, no push, naturally ages out. |
| git-committed | No (per-file commits) unless staged via a PR | `contents: write` to a branch | S1's minimal single-library case only; **must go through a PR**, never a direct push to a protected branch (security requirement, §12 below). |
| External object store | Yes | store-specific credentials | Large fleets / long retention; out of scope for P0/P1, noted for P2. |

Direct-commit-to-`main` is explicitly **not** the default `accepted-main`
update path for any backend that supports Actions cache or Releases — only
the git-committed backend needs a write, and that write goes through a PR
opened by the workflow, matching the task's "no direct push to protected
main as required path" acceptance criterion.

---

## 11. Validators (fail-loud, no silent shallow success)

Three new validation points, all hard failures (not warnings) when tripped:

1. **`build-output.json` validator** — every declared `headers/`/
   `generated-headers/` root is non-empty; every `targets[].binary` exists
   and its digest matches `digests{}`; `evidence.projection` is consistent
   with what's actually in `evidence/abicheck_inputs/` (non-empty TU count
   for `"declared"`).
2. **Requested-vs-effective depth gate** — reuses the mechanism PR #601
   introduces at the CLI layer (`DumpDepthNotSatisfiedError`, per this
   repo's Known Gaps section) but applied at `check-target` level so a
   `required-depth: source` check that only achieved `headers` is a hard
   failure of that check, never a silently-downgraded pass. This directly
   extends the acknowledged gap rather than duplicating a second enforcement
   path.
3. **`resolve-baseline` taxonomy** (§6 table) — every failure mode has a
   distinct, tested exit condition; none of them may exit 0/"compatible."

---

## 12. Security and reproducibility

- All new composite Actions/reusable workflows referenced from documentation
  examples use the same pinning discipline already established for
  elevated-permission workflows (AGENTS.md's "Action pinning is deliberately
  partial" note) — `check-target`/`resolve-baseline` carry no elevated
  permissions themselves (they read artifacts and write job outputs only),
  so tag-pinning is acceptable there, matching the existing policy's
  blast-radius reasoning; `publish-baseline.yml`/`update-main-baseline.yml`
  (which write releases/caches) get the same SHA-pinning bar as the existing
  `security.yml`/`publish.yml` gate.
- Fork PRs: `check-single.yml`/`check-project.yml` run under `pull_request`
  (not `pull_request_target`) by default in every example, so fork PRs never
  get write-scoped tokens; baseline-publishing workflows are `push`/
  `workflow_dispatch`-triggered only, never PR-triggered.
- `resolve-baseline` treats a baseline produced by a different tool/scanner
  version as `incompatible_evidence` unless explicitly allowlisted — this
  closes the "producer/scanner/aggregator version desync" class of finding
  the task calls out.
- Report `candidate_digest`/`baseline_digest` fields (§7) let a consumer
  detect a stale artifact from a previous run before trusting the verdict.

## 13. Decision log

**D1 — Center the model on the project lifecycle, not `aggregate`.**
Alternative: keep extending `abicheck aggregate` and the root action's input
surface incrementally. Rejected because the audit (finding 1) confirms
`aggregate` structurally cannot represent single-target, single-build, or
baseline-lifecycle scenarios — it consumes reports, it doesn't produce
checks. Recommendation: lifecycle-first, as decided above.

**D2 — New `resolve-baseline` primitive vs. folding into `check-target`.**
Alternative: keep baseline resolution inlined in each consumer, as
`action/run.sh:150-233` does today. Rejected because every S2/S19/S20/S21
failure mode is a resolution failure with no independent typed signal today
— duplicating that logic into `check-target` would recreate the same
untestable inline branch it's meant to replace. Recommendation: separate
primitive, per §4.

**D3 — Reusable workflows for matrix/fan-out, not more composite Actions.**
Alternative: a fourth+ composite action attempting matrix-like behavior via
nested `run:` loops. Rejected: composite actions cannot create GitHub jobs
(confirmed — no `runs.using: composite` schema supports `jobs:`), so any
dynamic matrix needs a reusable *workflow*. Recommendation: §4's four
reusable workflows, no composite-action alternative considered viable.

**D4 — Minimal primitive count: evaluated "one `check-target` + two
workflows" per the task's explicit prompt.** Considered collapsing
`resolve-baseline` into `check-target` and cutting `check-single.yml` (fold
into `check-project.yml` with a one-cell matrix). Rejected the full
collapse: `check-single.yml` is the *entire* onboarding experience for S1
(the single most common case) and a one-cell matrix workflow imposes matrix
overhead (artifact upload/download round-trip) on the simplest scenario
users will hit first. Kept `resolve-baseline` separate per D2. Net surface:
5 primitives (3 existing + 2 new) + 4 reusable workflows — smaller than a
literal per-scenario Action count (would be 28), larger than the task's
minimal-floor suggestion, justified by D2/D3's failure-mode reasoning.

**D5 — `.abicheck.yml` extension (B+C hybrid) vs. a new project-schema
file.** Compared all four options the task lists. Rejected "A: everything in
`.abicheck.yml`" because GitHub-runner-specific dynamic values (candidate
artifact path, SHA, token) don't belong in a portable, checked-in config —
they'd force a config edit on every CI run. Rejected "D: new versioned
project schema" as an unjustified second file format duplicating
`.abicheck.yml`'s existing policy/suppression sections. Chose B+C: portable
`targets:`/`profiles:`/`baseline:` block added to `.abicheck.yml` (B), plus
the separate, build-produced (not hand-authored) `build-output.json` (C) —
because build-output is generated data with a different lifecycle (one per
CI run) from project config (one per repo, hand-edited).

**D6 — Adopt `check-target` as the single new high-level primitive.**
Directly answers the task's "consider one `check-target` primitive plus two
reusable workflows" prompt: adopted `check-target` as proposed, but kept
four reusable workflows (not two) because `publish-baseline.yml`/
`update-main-baseline.yml` have materially different triggers (release vs.
default-branch-push) and write-permission scopes that would otherwise force
a workflow-level conditional on write access inside one shared workflow —
judged a worse blast-radius/readability trade than two small workflows.

**D7 — No `check-packages.yml`.** A package-only target (S13) differs from a
source-build target only in how `build-output.json` gets populated (a thin
unpack-adapter vs. a real build). Giving it a fifth workflow would duplicate
`check-project.yml`'s matrix/aggregate logic for no behavioral difference.
Rejected a dedicated workflow; the adapter is a P1 backlog item (companion
plan), not a new workflow.

**D8 — Safe vs. full source-evidence-projection model (S16).** Adopting the
full TU→link-unit→DSO attribution model now was rejected as premature: it
requires linker-invocation capture not yet built (`build_query.py` has only
partial zero-config compile-DB inference today), and shipping an
"automatic" projection before that exists would recreate exactly the
"silent shallow success" failure mode this ADR is meant to eliminate.
Adopted the safe, explicitly-declared-or-build-wide model now (§9), deferred
full attribution to P2.

**D9 — No second pilot repository was fabricated.** The task named a
"Vandal" repository and floated oneDAL PR #3693 as possible second pilots.
Neither has a locatable validation record in this repository (finding 5).
Rather than inventing acceptance findings for an unconfirmed integration,
this ADR records PVXS as the sole confirmed pilot and lists acquiring a
second real pilot's validation report as a P1/P2 backlog item (companion
plan, "Pilot validation gap").

---

## 14. Known gaps this ADR does not close

- **No second validated pilot** (D9) — a real risk to the "vendor
  toolchain / multiple DSO / multiple baseline channels" claims in §8
  (S9/S15/S21) staying aspirational until one exists.
- **Full source-evidence TU→DSO attribution** (§9, D8) is P2, not built
  here; S16's "required full model" is a documented target state only.
- **`build-output.json` producer tooling** (a real `abicheck build-output
  emit` helper, or documented hand-authoring path for CMake/Meson/Bazel/Make)
  does not exist yet — this ADR specifies the schema and consumer contract;
  the companion plan tracks building the producer side.
- This ADR does not itself change `action.yml`, `action/run.sh`,
  `abicheck/cli_aggregate.py`, or any schema file — see the companion plan
  for the PR sequence that implements it.

---

## Consequences

**Positive:** a project owner can now describe their situation in the
domain vocabulary above and land on exactly one canonical entry point
(§4/§8), instead of reverse-engineering which of five CLI modes and 51
inputs applies. `aggregate` stops being an implicit architectural center,
which removes the temptation to route single-target scenarios through it.
The report envelope (§7) gives every downstream consumer (PR comment, SARIF,
branch protection, `aggregate` itself) one unambiguous identity/status
contract instead of inferring it from verdict text.

**Negative / cost:** two new composite Actions, one new reusable-workflow
pair, three new JSON schemas, and a `.abicheck.yml` schema extension are net
new maintenance surface. The scenario-first documentation reorganization
(companion plan) touches most of `docs/user-guide/`. None of this is free,
and it is sequenced in the companion plan specifically so it lands as
independently reviewable PRs rather than one large rewrite.
