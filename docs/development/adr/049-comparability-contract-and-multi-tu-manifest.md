# ADR-049: Comparability Contract — Profile/Scope Fingerprints and the Multi-TU Manifest

**Date:** 2026-07-22
**Status:** Proposed — not implemented. This ADR records the target model and
component surface; [G32](../plans/g32-comparability-contract-and-multi-tu-manifest.md)
carries the phased implementation backlog.
**Decision maker:** (pending — recorded per repository convention.)

---

## Context

abicheck already solves several pieces of what "safe to compare" requires:
`ScopeOrigin` classifies every declaration as
`PUBLIC_HEADER`/`PRIVATE_HEADER`/`SYSTEM_HEADER`/`GENERATED`/`EXPORT_ONLY`
(ADR-024, `model.py:131-147`), `DumpDepthNotSatisfiedError`
(`cli_dump_helpers.py:313-431`) hard-fails rather than silently degrading
when an explicitly requested `--depth` isn't reached, `snapshot_cache.py`
hashes the actual transitively-reachable content of every header (not just a
depfile's path list, so a shadowing header earlier in the search path is
already a correct cache miss), and `serialization.py` already sorts every
set before emitting JSON (ADR-015). None of this was reinvented by mistake —
it means most of a "make snapshots trustworthy" proposal is already shipped
under different names, and this ADR only needs to decide the parts that
genuinely are not.

Two gaps are real and unaddressed:

1. **`dump()` collapses every requested header into one synthetic
   translation unit.** `dumper.py:370` builds the AST input as
   `"".join(f'#include "{h.resolve()}"\n' for h in hdrs)` and runs exactly
   one castxml/clang invocation over it, with one flat 120s timeout
   (`dumper.py:1043`). There is no way to give one header group its own
   forced include (e.g. an Arrow-derived adapter header that needs
   `arrow/api.h` included first) without injecting that include into every
   other header's parse, and no way to mark one header group "optional
   evidence" vs. "required — its absence must shrink the reported surface,
   never silently disappear from it."
2. **No gate runs before `checker.compare` to prove two snapshots were
   extracted under a comparable contract.** `checker_policy.py` has
   `SOURCE_FACT_COVERAGE_INCOMPLETE` (`:618`) and a tri-state
   `ReachabilityState` (`:1024`), but both degrade to a RISK-tier finding
   *inside* a verdict that still gets produced — they annotate, they don't
   block. If an old snapshot was dumped with `-H oneapi/dal.hpp` and a new
   snapshot was dumped with `-H oneapi/dal.hpp -H oneapi/dal/graph.hpp` (a
   manifest/CLI-flag drift between two CI runs, not a real API change),
   `compare` still runs and reports every `graph.hpp` declaration as an
   addition. That is a true statement about the two snapshot *files* and a
   false one about the *library* — the two snapshots don't cover the same
   declared surface, and nothing records that the comparison itself isn't
   sound, only its output.

Both gaps were identified, in much greater depth, in a review of abicheck's
snapshot architecture prompted by a real multi-TU/DPC++ scenario (a project
whose public surface spans an umbrella header, an Arrow-derived adapter
needing its own forced include, and a SYCL host/device compilation split).
This ADR extracts the decisions from that review that are genuinely new
work. Where the review's proposal re-described something abicheck already
has — public/private/external classification, deterministic serialization,
content-hash caching, RAM-aware parallel extraction (see D6) — this ADR
cross-references the existing ADR instead of re-deciding it, so the two
descriptions cannot drift apart.

## The one rule that does not change

Same authority boundary as ADR-028 D3, `buildsource/CLAUDE.md`'s "one rule,"
and ADR-041's restatement of it: nothing in this ADR may **manufacture** a
`BREAKING_KINDS`/`API_BREAK_KINDS` verdict, and nothing in it may
**suppress** one that artifact-backed L0–L2 evidence already proves. What
this ADR adds is a **precondition gate**: when two snapshots' extraction
contracts are not comparable, `compare` must say so instead of producing
*any* verdict — generalizing the same shape of decision
`DumpDepthNotSatisfiedError` already makes for depth, to profile and scope.
"Not comparable" must never render as `compatible` (a green check hiding
risk) and must never render as `breaking` (a false positive that erodes
trust in every other finding abicheck reports).

## Decision

### D1. `ExtractionContract` — profile fingerprint and scope fingerprint

Two new fields on `AbiSnapshot` (`model.py`), carried under a new
`contract: ExtractionContract | None` sub-object. Unlike ADR-041's
`extractor_passes`/`narrowed_passes` — purely advisory fields where an old
reader silently not recognizing them degrades to the accepted, documented
"under-call" failure mode (a RISK finding that doesn't fire, never a false
compatible/breaking verdict) — the comparability gate this ADR adds (D2) is
a **hard, verdict-blocking** mechanism whose entire purpose is preventing a
false verdict on incomparable data. An old abicheck binary that predates
this ADR has no code path that even looks for `contract`, so if the field
were added the same additive, no-bump way, that old binary would silently
compare two contract-bearing (and possibly incomparable) snapshots and
produce an ordinary verdict — exactly the failure mode this ADR exists to
close, just relocated to the reader-version boundary instead of the
extraction boundary.

**`serialization.py`'s existing forward-version handling is not, on its
own, that mechanism — it only warns.** `snapshot_from_dict` (`:556-572`)
already inspects `schema_version` against the running `SCHEMA_VERSION` and,
when the snapshot's is newer, calls `warnings.warn(...)` (a `UserWarning`)
and then **continues deserializing** — it never raises. A bare
`SCHEMA_VERSION` bump alone (11 → 12) does not close this ADR's gap: an old
abicheck reading a schema-12, `contract`-bearing snapshot would print a
warning most CI setups never surface, ignore the unrecognized `contract`
key, and still produce an ordinary verdict — the exact silent-incomparable-
data failure mode this ADR exists to prevent. D1 therefore adds a real
incompatible-reader guard, not just a version bump: a new
`_MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION_REQUIRING_HARD_REJECTION = 12` constant in
`serialization.py` (same naming convention as the existing
`_MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION_FOR_CV_FACTS`, `:88`), checked in `snapshot_from_dict`
*before* today's warn-only branch: when the snapshot's `schema_version` is
at or above that threshold and the running `SCHEMA_VERSION` is below it, a
new `IncompatibleSnapshotSchemaError` (`errors.py`) is raised instead of a
warning being emitted. Versions below the threshold keep today's
warn-and-continue behavior unchanged (the existing, deliberately lenient
default for ordinary additive fields, per ADR-041's `extractor_passes`
precedent) — only the specific jump that first introduces a
verdict-blocking field becomes a hard failure for an older reader.

**Known, permanent limitation — not something a later phase can close.**
This guard protects any reader running Phase-A-or-later code: it makes
*that* code hard-reject a schema it doesn't support instead of warning past
it, and is the right pattern for any *future* comparability-critical bump.
It does **not**, and structurally cannot, protect an already-deployed
pre-Phase-A binary — that binary's `snapshot_from_dict` has no
`_MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION_REQUIRING_HARD_REJECTION` check compiled into it at
all, only the unconditional warn-and-continue branch, and no change to
future abicheck releases can retroactively alter code already running
elsewhere. A fleet where some environments have upgraded past Phase A and
others haven't can still see a not-yet-upgraded reader silently produce an
ordinary verdict on a `contract`-bearing snapshot. This is the same
unavoidable boundary every additive capability gate has (an abicheck old
enough to predate `DumpDepthNotSatisfiedError` doesn't enforce it either)
— the mitigation is operational (upgrade a comparison pipeline's producer
and consumer together), not something this ADR's on-disk format can
guarantee unilaterally. Documented here so it's a known, accepted limit,
not a latent surprise discovered after Phase A ships.

- `profile_fingerprint: str` — a `sha256:`-prefixed digest of the
  **resolved** compile context: compiler family/version, target triple,
  `abi_dialect` (Itanium/MSVC), language standard, pointer width/endianness,
  and the *ordered* sequence of macro define/undef operations and include
  paths (order matters for `-D`/`-U`/`-I` — last-one-wins semantics are
  real). Computed from fields `dumper.py` already resolves today
  (`ast_producer`, `ast_toolchain`, `build_context_defines`,
  `language_profile`, `platform` — `model.py:507-648`); this is a
  normalization + hashing pass over existing data, not new extraction.
  Unknown/unrecognized compiler flags are hashed by default (fail closed,
  matching the review's "unknown ⇒ contract-affecting until proven
  otherwise" principle) rather than silently ignored.
- `scope_fingerprint: str` — a `sha256:`-prefixed digest of the
  **manifest-normalized** analysis scope: the set of translation units (by
  `name`, not by list position), each TU's ordered includes and forced
  includes, each TU's `required`/`contributes_to_abi` flags, and the
  `public_header_paths`/`public_header_dirs`/filtering policy already
  threaded through `dumper.py` today. The `contributes_to_abi` flag is a
  hashed input, not just a manifest-validation detail (D3): flipping a TU
  from `contributes_to_abi: false` to `true` changes which declarations
  feed the ABI model without necessarily changing that TU's includes at
  all, so a fingerprint computed only from includes/forced-includes would
  let exactly the kind of scope drift this ADR exists to catch pass through
  as "identical scope." Computed from the *normalized* manifest (D3), not
  raw YAML bytes — reordering two independent TU entries, or adding a
  comment, must not change the fingerprint; reordering includes *within*
  one TU, or changing either flag, must.

**Both fingerprints hash root-relative paths, never absolute or
side-specific ones — this is not optional, it protects abicheck's single
most common workflow.** `compare` already supports side-scoped
`--header old=v1/foo.h --header new=v2/foo.h` and
`--include old=inc1 --include new=inc2` (ADR-040, `cli_options.py:230+`)
for the ordinary two-checkout-tree comparison — the old and new sides
*necessarily* resolve to different absolute paths even when they cover the
identical logical surface, precisely because they live in different
checkouts. Hashing resolved absolute paths directly would make every
routine `compare` invocation fingerprint-mismatch and hard-fail as
`not_comparable` — the gate would break its primary use case on day one,
the exact inverse of what it's for. Each side's header/include/forced-
include paths are therefore normalized **relative to that side's own
resolution root** before folding into either fingerprint: for the legacy,
non-manifest CLI path, the root is the common ancestor **directory** of
that side's own inputs — each header path's *parent* directory and each
include directory itself, not the header paths taken literally (a pure
function of that side's own inputs, no new flag needed). Computing it from
the header paths directly, rather than their parents, degenerates in the
single-header-per-side case that's actually the common one: the "common
prefix" of a one-element path set is that whole path, so `old=v1/foo.h`
and `new=v2/bar.h` would both normalize their sole header to the same
empty/root marker, losing the filename entirely — two genuinely different
public scopes would then hash identically and wrongly pass the gate, the
opposite failure from the one this fix exists to close. Taking the parent
directory first means a lone header's basename survives normalization
(`v1/foo.h` → root `v1/`, normalized path `foo.h`); for the manifest-driven
path (D3), the root is the manifest file's own directory. Two sides with
the same logical directory layout (`include/foo.h` under each side's own
root) normalize to identical relative paths and produce equal fingerprints
regardless of where
each checkout happens to live on disk; a side whose logical layout actually
differs (a header moved to a different relative location) still changes the
fingerprint, correctly.

Both fingerprints live in a new `contract: ExtractionContract | None` field
on `AbiSnapshot` rather than flattening two more top-level fields onto an
already-large dataclass — `ExtractionContract` is the one new nested type
this ADR introduces on the model, deliberately scoped to just the two
fingerprints plus the resolved fields that produce them (so a report can
show *what* differs, not just that the hashes don't match).

**Modeling the field is not the same as populating it, and this ADR
requires both.** `dump()` (`dumper.py`) is the one place that already
resolves every input both fingerprints are computed from — it must call
`comparability.compute_extraction_contract(...)` and attach the result to
the `AbiSnapshot` it returns, for every dump, not only a manifest-driven
one (D3). Without this wired in from D1, `contract` stays `None` on every
freshly-produced snapshot, and since D2's gate only ever raises when
**both** sides carry a `contract`, two perfectly ordinary dumps would
silently take the same code path as the intentionally-lenient mixed-pair
case (D2) forever — the gate would be fully specified and fully inert.

**The whole-snapshot cache is the same bypass by a different route, and it
matters from day one, not just at D6's later cache-key extension.**
`service_dump_cache.cached_run_dump` looks up `snapshot_cache` *before*
calling `run_dump`/`dump()` and returns a cache hit unchanged — so a warm
cache entry written by a pre-this-ADR abicheck (schema 11, no `contract`
computed at all) served after upgrading to a version that implements this
ADR would still come back with `contract=None`, for the same reason a
never-populated `dump()` would: the code path that would have called
`compute_extraction_contract(...)` never runs on a cache hit. D1 therefore
also bumps `snapshot_cache._SNAPSHOT_CACHE_VERSION` (`:48`, currently
`"3"`) in the same change — folded into `_cache_key()` (`:196`) already, so
every pre-this-ADR cache entry misses exactly once and gets rebuilt through
the now-`contract`-populating `dump()`. This is deliberately separate from
D6's later `profile_fingerprint`/`scope_fingerprint`-as-cache-key-input
work: that closes a *different* gap (a pure compile-profile change with
identical header content not invalidating the cache); this one closes
"the cache doesn't know `contract` exists yet at all," and cannot wait for
D6's phase without leaving the gate inert for every warm-cache user in the
interim.

### D2. Comparability gate — hard-fail before symbol diff, not a RISK finding

New `ProfileMismatchError` / `ScopeMismatchError` (`errors.py`), raised from
a new `comparability.check_contracts_comparable(old, new)` called at the top
of `checker.compare`, before any `diff_*` module runs. Mirrors
`DumpDepthNotSatisfiedError`'s existing shape exactly: a `click.ClickException`
subclass at the CLI boundary (`cli.py`), a plain exception at the
`service.py`/`mcp_server.py` boundary (closing the same gap AGENTS.md's
"Known gaps" section already names for the depth contract — this ADR's gate
must not repeat that CLI-only mistake; D2 lands in `service.py`'s
`ScanRequest`/`compare_snapshots` and `mcp_server.py`'s MCP tools from the
start, not as a follow-up).

**A fourth surface reaches `checker.compare` besides the three named
above: `cli_compare_release.py`'s directory/package fan-out, and it needs
its own explicit fix, not just inherited behavior.**
`_compare_one_library` (`cli_compare_release.py:180-269`) wraps its entire
per-library flow in `except (click.ClickException, click.UsageError):` /
`except Exception:`, both returning `{"verdict": "ERROR", ...}` —
documented at `:1142` as flooring the release's exit code at 4 "regardless
of severity settings." `ProfileMismatchError`/`ScopeMismatchError` are
plain exceptions (not `click.ClickException`), so today's broad
`except Exception` would swallow them into the exact same `"ERROR"`/exit-4
bucket as a genuine crash — meaning one incomparable library inside a
release comparison would silently report as the *worst possible*
classification (an ABI break) instead of `not_comparable`, precisely
inverting this ADR's purpose on its one multi-library entry point.
`_compare_one_library` therefore gains a dedicated
`except (ProfileMismatchError, ScopeMismatchError) as exc:` branch, ordered
before the generic `except Exception`, returning a distinct
`{"verdict": "not_comparable", "reason": ...}` entry; the release-level
aggregator and exit-code computation (`docs/reference/exit-codes.md`'s
multi-library section) are extended to recognize that verdict value the
same way the single-library path does, rather than folding it into
`"ERROR"`.

On the reporting surface (`reporter.py`,
`sarif.py`, `junit_report.py`), a `not_comparable` result is a distinct
top-level state — `verdict: null`, a `reason` object naming the mismatched
fingerprint field(s) — never coerced into `COMPATIBLE`/`BREAKING`'s existing
enum values. A `--diagnostic-comparison` opt-in flag (default off) downgrades
the hard-fail to a tentative diff with `assurance: none` stamped on every
finding, for exploratory use — never the default, and never silent.
`verdict: null` is a **published contract change**, not just an internal
one: `abicheck/schemas/compare_report.schema.json` currently requires
`verdict` and restricts it to a fixed string enum with no `null` member, and
`tests/test_report_schema.py` validates emitted reports against exactly
that file — both must change in the same phase that starts emitting
`not_comparable`, or JSON output goes invalid (or the published schema goes
stale) the moment the gate first fires. This includes the schema's own
version metadata, not just its `verdict` constraint:
`abicheck/schemas/__init__.py`'s `REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION` (currently
`"2.12"`, a documented `MAJOR.MINOR` policy — every JSON report emits it as
`report_schema_version`) is bumped in the same change, and the published
mirror `docs/schemas/v1/compare_report.schema.json` is regenerated via the
existing `scripts/publish_schemas.py` so it stays byte-identical to the
packaged schema — `tests/test_report_schema.py`'s
`test_docs_mirror_matches_packaged_schema` already asserts that identity
and fails the build otherwise. **The exit code is part of this
same contract and must be pinned explicitly, not left implicit.**
`docs/reference/exit-codes.md` documents two co-existing `compare` exit
schemes (legacy: 0/2/4; severity-aware, with any `--severity-*` flag:
0/1/2/4) where `0` means *compatible* in both — a `not_comparable` result
must never exit `0` in either scheme, or the exact failure mode this ADR
exists to prevent (missing evidence reading as "safe") reappears one layer
down, at the process-exit boundary instead of the JSON `verdict` field. D2
reserves a new, distinct nonzero code for `not_comparable`, documented as
its own row in both exit-code tables, not folded into either existing
scheme's numbering.

**Mixed pairs (one side has a `contract`, the other doesn't) never hard-fail
— this is unambiguous, not left to implementer discretion.** The backward-
compatibility promise ("a snapshot from before this ADR compares exactly as
it does today") is not a soft goal to reconcile with the gate; a
contract-less snapshot's *absence* of evidence is exactly the "missing
evidence must never manufacture a block" situation ADR-028 D3's authority
rule already covers, extended here to the comparability contract instead of
symbol facts. `check_contracts_comparable` therefore only ever raises
`ProfileMismatchError`/`ScopeMismatchError` when **both** sides carry a
`contract` and it mismatches — a mixed pair takes the exact same code path
as a pair where neither side carries one, and comparing a newly-produced
snapshot against a pre-ADR baseline (the common "upgrade abicheck, keep the
stored CI baseline" workflow) never regresses into an unexpected
`not_comparable` result. `UNKNOWN_PROFILE` is **not** a `not_comparable`
reason and never blocks: it is a non-authoritative annotation on
an otherwise-ordinary verdict, surfaced only for a mixed pair, to tell the
reader "this comparison ran without being able to check profile/scope
drift on one side," without withholding the verdict itself.

**`UNKNOWN_PROFILE` is report-level metadata, not a `ChangeKind`/`Change`
finding at all — this went through two wrong designs before landing here,
worth recording so it isn't rediscovered.** The first attempt classified it
`RISK_KINDS`, matching `SOURCE_FACT_COVERAGE_INCOMPLETE`
(`checker_policy.py:618`)'s shape; that broke under
`--severity-potential-breaking=error`/`--severity-preset strict`, which
promotes any `RISK_KINDS` finding to a build failure (exit 2) — turning
every comparison against a pre-this-ADR baseline into a mass,
abicheck-version-triggered CI failure the instant a strict-severity team
upgrades, exactly the "upgrading abicheck breaks an unrelated, unchanged
pipeline" regression the backward-compatibility promise above exists to
rule out. The second attempt reclassified it `COMPATIBLE_KINDS`'s
`QUALITY_KINDS` subset instead, reasoning that `SOURCE_FACT_COVERAGE_INCOMPLETE`'s
`RISK_KINDS` tier is justified by reporting genuine *per-comparison*
evidence uncertainty (a fact family that failed or came back partial *this
run*) — a "fair game to fail strict CI on" property `UNKNOWN_PROFILE`
doesn't share, since it fires purely from being compared against a
pre-ADR baseline, a one-time rollout artifact untied to any real change.
That reclassification only relocated the same collision:
`--severity-quality-issues=error`/`--severity-preset strict` promotes
`QUALITY_KINDS` findings too (exit 1, "quality-only error") — proving the
underlying problem was never "which `ChangeKind` category," it's that
**every** category is reachable by *some* `--severity-*` flag, by design
(that's the whole point of severity gating existing). No `ChangeKind`
classification can be permanently severity-immune. `UNKNOWN_PROFILE`
therefore isn't one: it's a new field on the comparison result (alongside
the existing `assurance` field D2 already introduced for
`--diagnostic-comparison`) — e.g. `contract_coverage: "partial"` — set
whenever exactly one side carries a `contract`. It never enters the
`changes`/findings list any `--severity-*` flag scans, so it is
structurally, not just by convention, unreachable by severity promotion —
true under every current and future severity flag, not merely the ones
checked so far. `reporter.py`/`sarif.py`/`junit_report.py` surface it the
same way they already surface `assurance` — a plain report field, not a
finding.

### D3. Manifest and real multi-TU dump

New `abicheck/dump_manifest.py`: a strict YAML parser (unknown fields are
errors, not silently ignored) for a `roots` / `translation_units` document —
each TU carries `name` (unique), `includes` (ordered), `forced_includes`
(ordered, local to that TU only), `required: bool`, and
`contributes_to_abi: bool`, with the invariant
`contributes_to_abi=True ⇒ required=True` enforced at parse time (a TU whose
declarations feed the ABI model cannot also be allowed to fail silently —
this is the review's sharpest correctness point: "optional but
contributes" is the exact shape that produces false removals). All existing
single-header/`-H` CLI invocations construct a single-TU manifest internally
(one `legacy-main` TU) — no behavior change for a caller not opting into a
manifest file.

`dumper.py`'s `dump()` gains a manifest-driven path: **one castxml/clang
invocation per TU** (base compile profile + that TU's own forced includes),
each producing a normalized `TuFragment` (entities keyed by `entity_key`,
not raw AST), instead of today's single aggregate-then-parse call. This is
additive — the existing single-TU code path becomes the manifest path's
one-TU special case, not a parallel implementation to keep in sync.

A base compile profile (compiler, target, language standard, global flags)
is shared across all TUs in one manifest; **different compilers or target
triples across TUs in the same manifest are rejected at parse time** — that
is two different ABI contexts, which stay two separate snapshots (and two
separate `profile_fingerprint`s) rather than one snapshot pretending to
speak for both. Only forced includes and include order vary per TU.

### D4. Compatible merge across translation units

New `abicheck/tu_merge.py`, deliberately reusing `buildsource/crosscheck.py`
(`:215`, `run_crosschecks`)'s existing merge/cross-validate shape rather
than a new algorithm: for each `entity_key` seen in more than one TU's
fragment, merge is only trivial (union provenance, keep the richer
declaration) when the two declarations are **compatible** —
forward-declaration + definition, declaration + redeclaration, differing
only in an added default argument. Two full declarations disagreeing on
return type, layout, or calling convention is an `INCONSISTENT_DECLARATION`
conflict; a heterogeneous-context conflict (should D3's per-manifest
single-profile rule ever be relaxed later) is
`HETEROGENEOUS_ABI_CONTEXT`. A snapshot with unresolved conflicts is not a
`CompleteSnapshot` and cannot feed D2's comparability gate as a clean side.

`entity_key` deliberately excludes return type (keeping it in `abi_facts`,
not the merge key) — folding return type into identity turns a return-type
change into an unrelated add+remove pair instead of one detected change,
the same failure mode ADR-045/048 already fixed for old/new type matching,
applied here to same-version cross-TU identity instead.

### D5. SYCL/DPC++ host vs. device AST context selection

`sycl_metadata.py` today only classifies a **compiled binary's** exported
`piextDevice*` symbols (`:234,238`) — it has no visibility into which AST
context (host vs. `spir64` device target) a DPC++ frontend invocation
actually parsed. New `abicheck/sycl_context.py`: when the L2 clang backend
(`dumper_clang.py`) invokes a DPC++-capable compiler, it decodes the
frontend's possibly-multi-document JSON output as a sequence of
`{kind, target, ast}` contexts (streaming document boundaries, not a
bracket/string split), tags each with the compiler-reported target triple,
and selects the context matching the manifest's/CLI's requested
`frontend_context` (`host` by default). A run that produces only a
`spir64`/device context when `host` was requested is an extraction failure
(`AST_CONTEXT_MISSING`), not a successful-but-wrong snapshot — it must not
reach D1's fingerprinting at all. Fixture-first per the review's own
sequencing advice: a real captured multi-document DPC++ AST fixture and a
plain single-context clang fixture land before the stream parser, so the
parser is built against real output shape, not an assumption of it.

### D6. Resource-aware scheduling for the frontend, shared with `buildsource`

`buildsource/source_replay.py` already implements exactly the scheduling
policy the review asks for — a thread/process pool sized by
`min(cpu-derived cap, cgroup-`MemAvailable`-derived cap)`, documented in
`buildsource/CLAUDE.md`. Rather than a second implementation in `dumper.py`,
the RAM-probing/pool-sizing helper is factored out of `source_replay.py`
into a new leaf module, `abicheck/process_resources.py`, that both
`source_replay.py` and `dumper.py`'s new per-TU invocation loop (D3) import
— the "move the shared logic to a leaf module both sides can depend on"
rule AGENTS.md's import-cycle guidance already states, applied here instead
of growing a second scheduler. `dumper.py`'s per-TU castxml/clang calls run
under this pool instead of today's fully sequential loop; a killed/timed-out
TU is recorded with its exit signal, never silently retried as a clean
empty TU.

`snapshot_cache.py`'s existing content-hash cache key (`:130`) gains the
`profile_fingerprint`/`scope_fingerprint` as additional key inputs — the
cache already invalidates correctly on header-content drift (the review's
"shadowing header" scenario is not a real gap here, see Context); it does
not yet invalidate on a pure compile-profile change with identical header
content, which the two new fingerprints close.

## Non-goals

- Not a rewrite of `AbiSnapshot` into a four-layer contract/model/evidence/
  run-metadata document. `model.py`'s fields already sort into those
  buckets informally (see Context); this ADR adds two fingerprint fields and
  one gate, not a new top-level schema shape.
- Not a change to `ScopeOrigin`, `provenance.py`'s classification, or any
  existing public/private/external filtering — ADR-024 already solves the
  "reportable vs. supporting entity" problem the review's §6/§7 asked for.
- Not a rewrite of `crosscheck.py`'s intra-version evidence-source merge —
  D4 reuses its shape for a new axis (cross-TU, same evidence source), it
  does not change what `crosscheck.py` itself does today.
- Not a canonical/hash-only serialization mode distinct from the persisted
  JSON. `serialization.py` already sorts sets; D1's fingerprints are
  computed from specific resolved fields, not a whole-snapshot canonical
  hash, so no second serialization path is needed.
- Not a coverage-of-expected-public-headers check (the review's §1.6). A
  manifest-declared `expected_public_headers` inventory is a plausible
  future addition once D3 ships, but is not required for the comparability
  gate itself and is left to a follow-up phase (see G32) rather than
  bundled into this decision.
- Not a change to exit codes or the legacy (non-severity-aware) `compare`
  contract for a snapshot pair that carries no `contract` field — see D2's
  backward-compatibility note.

## Consequences

**Positive:** a manifest/flag drift between two extraction runs (the
motivating oneDAL-style scenario — an umbrella header gaining a new
top-level include between CI runs, unrelated to any real API change) is
caught and reported as `SCOPE_MISMATCH` instead of a page of false
`*_added` findings. A genuine per-TU forced-include need (Arrow-style
adapter headers) becomes expressible without contaminating every other
header's parse. DPC++ host/device context confusion becomes a hard
extraction failure instead of a silently-wrong snapshot.

**Costs:** D3 is the highest-risk, highest-effort piece — it changes
`dumper.py`'s hot path from one invocation to N, and D4's merge lattice is
new surface with real edge cases (the review's own worked examples:
forward-decl + definition, ambiguous default-argument-only differences).
D5 needs a real captured DPC++ multi-document fixture before implementation
can proceed safely, which is external-tool-dependent to acquire. A
snapshot's `profile_fingerprint` is sensitive to any resolved-field
addition in future ADRs (a later ADR that adds a new ABI-affecting compile
flag to what `dumper.py` resolves must remember to fold it into D1's
fingerprint inputs, or the two silently drift apart) — this is called out
explicitly in G32 so it isn't rediscovered the hard way.
