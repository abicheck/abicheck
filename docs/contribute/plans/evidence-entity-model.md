# Evidence entity model — one identity, explicit joins, typed coverage

**Origin:** An architecture review (2026-09-23) of how the L2 snapshot, the
header graph (`buildsource/header_graph.py`), and the public-surface graph
(`compare/surface_graph.py`) relate. Finding: abicheck has a rich L2
snapshot and a useful dependency graph, but they are **not yet one
consistently identified, queryable evidence model**.

**ADR:** none new. This plan finishes goals [ADR-063](../adr/063-one-semantic-pipeline.md)
already states (Phase 2 identity, Phase 3 "public surface as a graph query",
Phase 6 `SemanticIR`) and reuses the release-contract model of ADR-065 and
the "one contract, many providers" section of `AGENTS.md`. A phase that
changes a snapshot or report schema needs an ADR-063 amendment first.

**Type:** Initiative plan (cross-cutting: `model/`, `extract/`, `compare/`,
`buildsource/`, `storage/`).

**Effort:** L–XL overall. Expect roughly 8–15 PRs. **Risk:** Phases 1 and 2
change node IDs and the snapshot schema (`SCHEMA_VERSION` bump, golden-file
churn). Phases 0, 4 and 5 are additive.

**Relationship to other plans:** [One Semantic Pipeline](one-semantic-pipeline.md)
owns the IR and identity primitives. This plan owns *using them as the one
join key* across L0/L1/L2/L4 evidence. [Storage format v2](storage-format-v2.md)
owns persistence. This plan keeps the versioned JSON snapshot as the
external baseline format and does not propose replacing it.

## Problem

| # | Gap | Consequence |
|---|-----|-------------|
| 1 | **Entity identity.** The header graph and the public-surface builder can represent one declaration under different node IDs. `surface_graph.py` uses the parse-time `entity_id` when present and otherwise falls back to approximate `decl://`/`type://` IDs. Its own module docstring defers unifying the schemes to "a later phase". | A shared graph container does not guarantee that evidence joins onto one entity. Nodes can be duplicated, and cross-layer queries have to reconcile IDs themselves. |
| 2 | **Implicit L0/L1 ↔ L2 joins.** Ordinary L2 graphs hold header and type relationships. Exports and debug facts live in separate snapshot sections, or as per-declaration `Fact[bool]`s (`model/surface_facts.py`). Rich source↔symbol↔debug joins exist only with L4 evidence. | A graph traversal alone cannot answer "which public declaration is backed by this export and this debug type?" |
| 3 | **Scope and ownership.** Public/internal classification comes from header roots plus provenance. An include edge is a different fact. No graph-level owner says which package, component or namespace promises a declaration. | A release-wide header tree compared with one member binary can produce misleading public-vs-export findings (MKL/oneDAL). The release fan-out already solves this through `model/release_surface.py`, but graph queries cannot see that model. |
| 4 | **Coverage per relationship.** Coverage is tracked per extractor pass (`docs/learn/graph-coverage.md`). A generic query must interpret passes itself. | "No edge" is easily read as "no dependency", especially when comparing L2 with L4. |
| 5 | **Derived vs. observed edges.** `_add_export_edges` in `compare/surface_graph.py` emits `exports` edges from a declaration's *own linker name*. They are not matched against the observed export table, as the helper's docstring says. | Edges that look alike carry very different authority. A persisted derived edge can go stale relative to the snapshot records it was projected from. |
| 6 | **Cost of materialization.** The snapshot, graph nodes/edges, merge facts and indexes are all Python objects. `service_header_graph_attach.py` already skips a population pass after measuring it as 44–71% slower on small cases. | "Put everything in the graph" could worsen the oneDAL memory problem, however well the JSON compresses. |

## Goal

One **canonical entity index**, fed by separate evidence producers. Queries
run over typed relationships that carry their evidence class and coverage.

    A["L2 header declarations"] --> E["Canonical entity index"]
    B["L0 observed exports"] --> E
    C["L1 observed debug types"] --> E
    D["L4 source and build facts"] --> E
    E --> G["Typed relationships and coverage"]
    G --> Q["Comparison and impact queries"]
```

"Fed by" never forces a match. An ambiguous or absent join stays a
first-class state. A public inline declaration may have no export, and an
export may have no known public declaration. Both are valid.

### Invariants (the acceptance contract)

- **I1 — one ID per entity.** Every producer that names a declaration or type
  resolves it through the same identity function (ADR-063 `EntityId`/
  `OccurrenceId`). Two producers that see the same declaration yield the
  same node ID. An entity with no resolvable identity gets an explicit
  `unresolved` node, never an approximate one that silently collides.
- **I2 — joins are evidence, not name equality.** A declaration's mangled
  name is never treated as proof of an observed export. Every cross-layer
  edge records its join state: `matched`, `ambiguous` (with candidates) or
  `unmatched`.
- **I3 — every edge kind declares its evidence class:** `observed` (an
  extractor saw it), `resolved_join` (two observations were joined under a
  stated rule) or `derived` (a projection of snapshot records). Each class
  names its producer, inputs, and recomputation rule. A `derived` edge is
  recomputed from the records, never trusted when persisted.
- **I4 — absence is typed.** A query for edge kind *K* in scope *S* returns
  `present`, `proven_absent` or `unknown`. `proven_absent` requires the
  producer of *K* to have covered *S*.
- **I5 — the contract is modelled once.** Public roots and any namespace
  selection are explicit contract inputs. Declarations and exports relate to
  providers through the existing release-surface model rather than a second
  one.
- **I6 — materialization is opt-in until measured.** No graph view becomes
  unconditional without a peak-RSS and latency measurement on a real
  large-product dump.

## Phases

Ordered by how many incorrect conclusions each phase prevents, not by size.

| Phase | Scope | Size | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Evidence-class retag** | Add an evidence-class attribute to the surface-graph edge kinds. Rename or retag the linker-name `exports` edge as `derived` (for example `declares_linker_name`). Keep the name `exports` free for a future observed join. Update `tests/test_compare_surface_graph.py`. No schema change unless graph edges are persisted; check first. | S | — |
| **1 — Identity invariants** | Small L2/L0/L1 fixtures stating I1 as property tests (the same declaration seen via castxml, clang, DWARF, and the export table → one node). Then route `surface_graph.py` and `header_graph.py` node IDs through `semantic_ir`/`EntityId`, with explicit alias and unresolved nodes. Migrate readers in the same PR as producers. | L | ADR-063 Phase 2/6 |
| **2 — Explicit cross-layer joins** | An observed `exports` join (export table → entity, via `model/export_index.py`'s projection) and an L1 debug-type → entity join, each carrying I2 join states. Replaces the per-query reconciliation readers do today. | M–L | 1 |
| **3 — Ownership in the graph** | Expose `model/release_surface.py` providers and contract inputs (public roots, namespace selection) as graph-level owner relations. Wiring, not new design. | M | 1 |
| **4 — Coverage-aware queries** | A query API returning I4's three-valued answer per edge kind and scope, built on the existing per-pass coverage records and `Fact` statuses. | M | 0, 2 |
| **5 — Measure, then decide materialization** | Profile a real large-product (oneDAL-class) dump with `ABICHECK_MEMORY_TRACE` and `scripts/bench_release_memory.py`: snapshot vs. graph vs. index cost. Decide which views to persist, which to compute on demand, and whether to use compact tables or lazy section loading (storage v2 Phase 2). | S to measure; follow-up TBD | — (can run in parallel) |

Phases 0 and 5 are independent and small, so they can start now. Phase 5's
numbers should inform Phases 1–2 before those choose what to materialize.

## Tests

- Phase 1 needs primitive-level property tests of the identity function
  (order-independence, no merge without shared identity evidence, no
  collision of an unresolved node onto a resolved one), per `AGENTS.md`'s
  "Primitive-level property tests".
- Phase 2 needs fixtures for each join state: a public inline declaration
  with no export (`unmatched`, not a missing export), an export with no
  declaration, and two declarations competing for one export (`ambiguous`).
- Phase 4 needs an oracle test: an edge kind whose producer did not run
  answers `unknown` and never `proven_absent`.

## Out of scope

- Replacing the JSON snapshot format. Storage optimization follows once
  I1–I4 settle the semantics.
- Expanding the graph vocabulary beyond what I1–I5 require.
- Function/variable identity for PDB/BTF/CTF (ADR-063 Phase 6's documented
  gap). Phase 1 treats such entities as `unresolved` rather than inventing
  identity.
