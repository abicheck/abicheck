# Application Compatibility Check

`compare --used-by APP` answers: **"Will my application still work with the new library version?"**

Unlike a plain `compare` (whose verdict and exit code reflect the whole
library), `--used-by` scopes the **verdict and exit code** to just the
changes that affect the specific application binary you provide — the
report still lists every library change, but adds a per-app verdict/summary
and makes that scoped verdict (not the full-library one) drive the exit
code. This is the application-centric view of ABI compatibility.

> **History note:** this used to be a standalone `abicheck appcompat`
> command. The pre-1.0 CLI reset folded it into `compare --used-by` (ADR-043)
> — the full library comparison runs once, and the worst app-scoped result

## When to use `--used-by`

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Library maintainer checking all ABI changes | `abicheck compare` |
| App developer checking if *their app* is affected | `abicheck compare --used-by ./myapp` |
| Distro packager checking if app X works with new libfoo | `abicheck compare --used-by ./appX` |

---

## Full mode (old + new library)

Provide the old library, the new library, and the application binary via `--used-by`:

```bash
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 --used-by ./myapp
```

With headers for deeper analysis:

```bash
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 --used-by ./myapp \
  -H include/foo.h
```

`--used-by` is repeatable, so one comparison can be scoped to several
consumer applications at once:

```bash
abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 libfoo.so.2 \
  --used-by ./myapp --used-by ./otherapp -H include/foo.h
```

This will:

1. Parse each application binary to extract required symbols
2. Run the full library comparison (same as plain `compare`) — the report
   still lists every library change, not just the app-relevant ones
3. Check symbol availability in the new library
4. Internally partition the library's changes into those relevant to each
   application's imports and those that are not, to compute a per-app count
   and verdict (see "How symbol filtering works" below)
5. Compute an app-specific verdict per `--used-by` app, and fold the worst
   one into the run's primary verdict/exit code

### Example output

The full-library report (same body plain `compare` would produce) is
rendered first, followed by an appended `--used-by` summary. When the
app-scoped verdict differs from the full-library verdict, a banner states
which one the exit code actually reflects:

```text
**Scoped verdict: BREAKING** (this is what the exit code reflects; the full
library verdict above is COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK).

# Comparison Report

**Library:** `libfoo.so.1` → `libfoo.so.2`
**Verdict:** `COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK`

... (the full, unfiltered set of library changes) ...

## Scoped to --used-by applications

- ./myapp: BREAKING (missing 1 symbol(s), 0 version(s), 1 relevant change(s))
```

The full-library report body is **not** filtered down to app-relevant
changes — every change is still listed there. The `--used-by` section names
each app's scoped verdict and a small missing-symbol/relevant-change count;
the `json` format instead adds `used_by` (per-app detail, including
`missing_symbols`/`missing_versions`/`relevant_change_count`) and
`full_verdict` keys alongside the usual payload, with `verdict` overwritten
to the scoped verdict. (Exact rendering depends on `--format`; see
`abicheck compare --help` for the full output-format list.)

---

## What's no longer directly available

Two pieces of the old standalone `appcompat` command don't have a CLI
replacement after the ADR-043 reset — both were narrower diagnostic modes
that didn't fit the unified `compare` surface:

- **Weak mode** (`appcompat APP --check-against LIB`, checking symbol
  availability with no old library at all — no diff, no change detection) —
  no CLI replacement. The underlying logic still exists as
  `abicheck.appcompat.check_against()` for Python API use.
- **`--list-required-symbols`** (dump the app's imported symbols/versions and
  exit) — no CLI replacement. Use `abicheck.appcompat.parse_app_requirements()`
  from the Python API to get the same `AppRequirements` data (imported
  symbols, needed libraries, required ELF symbol versions) programmatically.

If you relied on either of these in a script, the closest CLI-only fallback
is `abicheck deps tree ./myapp` (see [Companion Commands](companion-commands.md)),
which reports whether the application's dependencies resolve and its
required symbols bind — a different, broader check (whole dependency stack,
not one candidate library file) but often enough to catch the same class of
problem in CI.

## Options reference

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `OLD_INPUT` / `NEW_INPUT` | Old and new library (`.so`/`.dll`/`.dylib`, JSON snapshot, or ABICC dump) — same as plain `compare`. With `--used-by`, a JSON snapshot works only if it carries binary evidence (a `dump` of a real library, not headers-only) — its `elf`/`pe`/`macho` field is what the app's imports resolve against. |
| `--used-by FILE` | Application binary whose imports/required symbol versions scope the comparison (repeatable). Mutually exclusive with `--required-symbol`/`--required-symbols`. |
| `--verify-runtime` | With `--used-by`: actually run each consumer binary once against OLD and once against NEW (see [Runtime verification](#runtime-verification-verify-runtime) below). |
| `-H` / `--header` | Public header file or directory (repeatable, side-aware with `old=`/`new=`) |
| `-I` / `--include` | Extra include directory for castxml (repeatable, side-aware) |
| `--lang` | Language mode: `c++` (default) or `c` |
| `--format` | Output format: `markdown` (default), `json`, `sarif`, `html`, `junit`, `review` |
| `-o` / `--output` | Write report to file |
| `--scope-public-headers` / `--no-scope-public-headers` | Restrict findings to the public-header ABI surface (on by default) |
| `--severity-preset` | `default`, `strict`, or `info-only` (switches to the severity-aware exit scheme) |
| `--severity-abi-breaking` / `--severity-potential-breaking` / `--severity-quality-issues` / `--severity-addition` | Per-category severity overrides (`error`/`warning`/`info`) |
| `--suppress` | Suppression file (YAML) |
| `--policy` | Verdict policy: `strict_abi` (default), `sdk_vendor`, `plugin_abi` |
| `--policy-file` | Custom YAML policy overrides |
| `-v` / `--verbose` | Debug output |

See `abicheck compare --help` for the complete flag set — `--used-by` is one
option among the full `compare` surface, not a separate command with its own
flags.

## Runtime verification (`--verify-runtime`)

Everything above is **static**: it reads the consumer binary's own import
table and the new library's export table, without running either. Most ABI
breaks are visible that way, but not all of them — a struct layout change
that leaves every symbol name intact can still corrupt memory at runtime.
`--verify-runtime` (ADR-044 P2 item 2) adds a **dynamic**, opt-in
corroborating check on top of the static one:

```bash
abicheck compare old.so new.so --used-by myapp --verify-runtime
```

For each `--used-by` app, this actually runs the binary twice — once with
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` pointed at the old library, once at the new one — with
`LD_BIND_NOW=1` set both times. `LD_BIND_NOW` forces the dynamic linker to
resolve every symbol reference immediately at load time (the same eager
binding a `-z now`-linked production deployment gets), instead of lazily on
first call — so a missing symbol fails loudly and immediately rather than
silently, on whichever code path happens to call it first, at some point in
the future.

If the app loads and runs cleanly against the old library, but the dynamic
linker itself reports `symbol lookup error: ... undefined symbol: X` against
the new one, `--verify-runtime` emits a `consumer_runtime_load_failed`
finding (`COMPATIBLE_WITH_RISK`) naming `X`. This is deliberately narrow: it
only interprets the dynamic linker's own explicit "I could not resolve this
symbol" message, never the app's own exit code or general crash behavior —
an app can legitimately exit nonzero for reasons that have nothing to do
with the library (a missing input file, a usage error), so treating that as
a "runtime regression" would be noisy and unreliable. Because of that
narrowness, this is always a **RISK**-tier finding, never `BREAKING` on its
own — an execution environment can fail for reasons unrelated to the library
(sandboxing, an unrelated missing dependency), so `--verify-runtime` only
*corroborates* the static scanner, it never replaces it or overrides its
verdict.

**Requirements and limits:**

- Both OLD and NEW must be real library binaries on disk (not JSON
  snapshots) — there is no file to point `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at otherwise.
  `--verify-runtime` is silently skipped for any app where this doesn't hold.
- **Linux-only.** `LD_BIND_NOW`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are glibc/ELF mechanisms
  with no reliable equivalent on macOS (System Integrity Protection strips
  `DYLD_*` environment variables from most binaries) or Windows (no
  env-var-driven early-bind/preload for PE loading). On any other platform,
  `--verify-runtime` is a no-op.
- Each run has a fixed timeout; a consumer that hangs is treated the same as
  one that never regressed (no finding), not as a failure — a timeout has no
  specific missing symbol to name, so it isn't attributable to the library
  change with the same confidence.
- The consumer binary is executed on your machine, in your environment, with
  whatever privileges the `abicheck` process has. Only pass `--verify-runtime`
  for a consumer binary you trust to run.

## Exit codes

`compare --used-by` computes the exit code from the worst of every
`--used-by` app's own scoped verdict — the full-library verdict is folded
into the rendered report as informational context (see "Example output"
above) but does **not** participate in the exit-code calculation:

| Exit code | Verdict | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `0` | `COMPATIBLE` / `NO_CHANGE` | Application(s) safe with the new library |
| `2` | `API_BREAK` | Source-level break affecting an app's symbols |
| `4` | `BREAKING` | Binary ABI break or missing symbols |
| `64` | usage error | Bad arguments/invocation |

### `--severity-*` flags have no effect here

Unlike plain `compare`, a scoped `--used-by` (or `--required-symbol(s)`) run
always uses this fixed legacy mapping — passing `--severity-preset` or any
other `--severity-*` option does **not** switch it to the severity-aware
`0`/`1`/`2`/`4` scheme described in [Exit Codes](../reference/exit-codes.md).
The scoped exit code is derived purely from the worst app-scoped `Verdict`
(`BREAKING` → `4`, `API_BREAK` → `2`, otherwise `0`). One consequence: a
missing required symbol/version is always `Verdict.BREAKING`, so it always
exits `4` — even under `--severity-preset info-only` — but that's because
severity presets don't reach the scoped path at all, not because of a
special-cased floor. If you need severity-aware exit codes for the
app-relevant subset of changes, don't pass `--used-by`; run plain `compare`
with your `--severity-*` flags and use `--show-only`/the JSON report to
inspect the changes touching your app's imports instead.

---

## How symbol filtering works

Each `--used-by` application binary is parsed to extract:

- **Imported symbols** — undefined symbols in `.dynsym` (ELF), import table (PE), or symbol table (Mach-O)
- **Library filter** — only symbols imported from the target library are considered (using ELF `.gnu.version_r`, PE DLL name, or Mach-O two-level namespace)
- **Required versions** — ELF version tags from `.gnu.version_r`

A library change is **relevant** to an app if any of these conditions hold:

1. The change's symbol is in the app's imported symbol set
2. The change's `affected_symbols` overlap with the app's imports (type change propagation)
3. The change is `SONAME_CHANGED` (affects all consumers)
4. The change is `COMPAT_VERSION_CHANGED` (Mach-O, affects all consumers)
5. The change is `SYMBOL_VERSION_DEFINED_REMOVED` for a version the app requires

All other changes are classified as **irrelevant** — the library changed, but the application doesn't use the affected symbols.

## Supported binary formats

| Format | Application | Library | Symbol filtering |
|--------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **ELF** (Linux) | `.so`, executables | `.so` | `.gnu.version` + `.gnu.version_r` correlation |
| **PE** (Windows) | `.exe`, `.dll` | `.dll` | Import table DLL name matching (incl. ordinal imports) |
| **Mach-O** (macOS) | executables, `.dylib` | `.dylib` | Two-level namespace library ordinal |

## CI integration

### GitHub Actions example

Check if your application works with a library update in CI:

```yaml
- name: Check app compatibility
  run: |
    abicheck compare libfoo.so.1 ./build/libfoo.so.2 \
      --used-by ./build/myapp \
      -H include/foo.h \
      --format json -o appcompat.json
```

---

## Python API

```python
from pathlib import Path
from abicheck.appcompat import check_appcompat, check_against, parse_app_requirements

# Full mode (old + new library) — app_path, old_lib_path, new_lib_path
result = check_appcompat(
    Path("./myapp"), Path("libfoo.so.1"), Path("libfoo.so.2"),
)
print(result.verdict, result.symbol_coverage)

# Weak mode (no old library — symbol availability only)
weak = check_against(Path("./myapp"), Path("libfoo.so.2"))
print(weak.missing_symbols)

# List required symbols only (library_name filters which needed-lib's
# imports are reported, e.g. the SONAME)
reqs = parse_app_requirements(Path("./myapp"), "libfoo.so.1")
print(reqs.undefined_symbols, reqs.needed_libs, reqs.required_versions)
```
