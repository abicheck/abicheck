"""Shared qualified-name segmentation and versioned inline-namespace helpers.

Leaf module (no imports from the rest of ``abicheck``) so it can be shared
between ``diff_namespaces.py`` (which owns the segment-splitting logic this
module was extracted from) and any other detector that needs to recognize a
versioned inline-namespace segment (``v1``, ``_V2``, ``__1``, ...) without
re-implementing the same regex.

A versioned inline namespace makes the *same* declaration reachable under
two qualified spellings: the full path (``detail::v1::x``) and the
version-elided path (``detail::x``) that unqualified lookup from the
enclosing scope also resolves to. When a header-AST producer surfaces both
spellings as separate top-level declarations, a name-keyed detector that
doesn't canonicalize away the version segment double-reports the identical
change once per spelling.

``diff_namespaces.py``'s function/type detectors use :func:`segments`/
:func:`version_strip_segments` directly, gated on real extraction-data
identity (a shared mangled name, a shared source location) before ever
merging two spellings -- see its own module docstring. There is
deliberately **no** merge helper here for a plain name-keyed mapping like
``AbiSnapshot.constants``: a header constant carries no identity beyond its
own value, and value-equality alone was tried and repeatedly shown
(Codex review, P1, three rounds) to be indistinguishable from coincidence
in both directions -- it can hide a real value divergence between two
unrelated declarations that happen to start equal, and it can also merge
two unrelated declarations that never even coexist in the same snapshot,
each present on only one side. ``diff_symbols._diff_constants`` therefore
compares ``AbiSnapshot.constants`` unmodified; double-reporting a constant
value change once per versioned-namespace spelling is an accepted, documented
limitation (see that function's docstring) rather than a heuristic that
cannot be made sound with the data available today.
