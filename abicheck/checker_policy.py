"""Central change policy registry and verdict computation.

Classification sets (BREAKING_KINDS, COMPATIBLE_KINDS, etc.) and IMPACT_TEXT
are now DERIVED from the single-declaration registry in ``change_registry.py``.
Adding a new ChangeKind requires only one entry there — no shotgun surgery.

Hierarchy (5-tier):
    BREAKING_KINDS      → category 1: binary ABI incompatibilities
    API_BREAK_KINDS     → category 2a: source-level breaks (recompilation required)
    RISK_KINDS          → category 2b: binary-compatible but deployment risk present
    QUALITY_KINDS       → category 3: problematic behaviors (COMPATIBLE minus additions)
    ADDITION_KINDS      → category 4: new API surface (subset of COMPATIBLE_KINDS)

    COMPATIBLE_KINDS    = ADDITION_KINDS ∪ QUALITY_KINDS
