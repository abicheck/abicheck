"""clang L2 header-parse error analysis (split out of ``dumper.py``).

Pure string-only diagnostics over clang stderr — the C→C++ language-probe signal
(:func:`_is_missing_cpp_stdlib_header_error`) and the ``#error`` header
attribution (:func:`_headers_failing_in_aggregate`) — plus the graceful
exclusion driver (:func:`retry_excluding_error_headers`) that drops headers not
meant for direct inclusion and re-parses. Kept in its own module so ``dumper.py``
stays under the file-size cap; the parsers are unit-tested without a compiler.

#: project headers (oneTBB itself ships a ``version.h``), so matching those could
#: re-parse a broken C build as C++ — silently caching a wrong AST instead of
#: reporting the genuine missing dependency (Codex review). In practice the first
#: miss for a C++ TU parsed in C mode is always a ``<cXXX>`` header (libstdc++
#: pulls them in early); the rare "pure-C++ header missing first" case is handled
#: by passing ``--lang c++`` explicitly.

#: include-order ``#error`` on an otherwise-public header — "Set FOO to include

    The L2 aggregate TU emits one ``#include`` per header — header ``i`` on line
    ``i + 1``. A header not meant to be included directly raises a preprocessor
    ``#error`` (e.g. oneTBB's ``detail`` headers: "Do not #include this internal
    header directly"). A preview/feature-macro gate ("Set TBB_PREVIEW_… to
    include …") is *not* treated as a guard — it surfaces so the user defines the

    fires inside an *included* file, clang prints the include chain whose outermost
    frame is the aggregate TU — ``In file included from <agg>:<N>:`` — immediately
    before the ``error:`` line. ``<N>`` therefore identifies the offending

    is always printed first and persists until the next aggregate-rooted chain).

    ``#error`` (e.g. ``#error "define MYLIB_CONFIG first"``), or an error in the
    aggregate file itself is therefore *not* dropped — it surfaces as the hard
